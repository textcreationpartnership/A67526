            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>YOUTH is the Strength and Ornament of the Nation, and therefore great regard ought to be had to it, eÅ¿pecially in Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating and Å¿eaÅ¿oning it with thoÅ¿e pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Advantages and Qualifications that may render it comfortable in it Å¿elf, and conformable to the Publick Good. It is aptly Emblem'd by many things, as pliant Reeds, bending to the blaÅ¿ts of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry flattering Wind; by young <hi>Cupids,</hi> blowing Bubbles in the Air, and eagerly purÅ¿uing them, with a fondneÅ¿s of their Gaiety and various colours, till they break and vaniÅ¿h; by expanded Wax, whoÅ¿e Å¿oftneÅ¿s makes it liable to take any ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion: And indeed, thoÅ¿e that come unfledged abroad, or too early into the World, have great need of Å¿ober and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35213:3"/>Å¿ound Advice, and to arm themÅ¿elves with precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their Å¿afety, to preÅ¿erve their Reputation, Health and Fortunes: For let me plainly tell them, the World is treacherous and deceitful, and they almoÅ¿t every where are apt to tread on Suares, if they go on heedleÅ¿s, and without a diligent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pection. There are ThouÅ¿ands that lye in wait to prey upon the imbicillity of Young Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; who like <hi>Syrens,</hi> labour to Charm them with Å¿weet flattering Notes, on Ruinous CoaÅ¿ts, that they may gain by the Shipwreck of their Good Names; and what the induÅ¿try of Indulgent Parents has laid up for them in reÅ¿erve, or already beÅ¿towed on them; nay even what has been acquired by their own induÅ¿try, e'er the Seducers of their Tranquility, found in an unluckey Moment, inÅ¿inuating ways to work upon good nature; and this is done by Å¿uch Å¿tudied Tricks, Arts and Devices, to winde themÅ¿elves into the good liking, confidence and truÅ¿t of the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Sort; that Learning, Parts, and an indifferent Stock of Prudence are not very often a Å¿ufficient Defence, againÅ¿t the invading MiÅ¿chief, that has of late Å¿pread like a Gangren; not to the undoing of a particular PerÅ¿on, but to the invitable Overthrow of many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, which (had this dangerous Rock been avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereon their Fame and Fortunes are broken) might have been at this day proÅ¿perous and flouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But Å¿ince paÅ¿t things cannot be recalled, let thoÅ¿e that lie open and lyable to the like danger and miÅ¿carriages, take timely Warning and Advice, as a Sovereign Remedy againÅ¿t Å¿uch a Å¿weeping Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which labours to become in a great meaÅ¿ure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical, to the Juvenile Portion of Mankind; for let me tell you, when the Å¿curvy Hour of Å¿o great a Misfortune has overtaken any of us, we may then grow angry with our Å¿elves, and would perhaps grow
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35213:3"/>WiÅ¿er, Å¿ee our Folly, and in what we have been before Å¿hort-Å¿ighted, and over-reached. Allowing then we could hinder or prevent it, if it were to be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, though Å¿ome indeed, too much relying on their own Å¿trength, for want of Å¿ound Advice, and a true InÅ¿ight of the matter, after Å¿uch ReÅ¿olves of taking good Heed to their Ways; have Å¿tumbled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deeper Pit than before, as not Remembering, that we can no more have WiÅ¿dom than Grace, when ever we think fit to call for it; there are Times and Periods fixed for both, and when they are too long neglected, the PuniÅ¿hment is, they are irrevocable, and nothing remains, but a uÅ¿eleÅ¿s Grief for the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of having thrown them out of our power.</p>
               <p>It's a dangerous Step Youth make into the World, when they think they are capable of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it; for Å¿uch is the depravity of the Times, that even Virtue alone will not Å¿ecure one, except it is attended with a great deal of Prudence, and both are but neceÅ¿Å¿ary for their Guard: Nor ought they to Å¿tir without them; for the Enemy is abroad, and they are Å¿ure to be taken, if they are found Å¿tragling.</p>
               <p>Thus much by way of Introduction, and Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; my next BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s is, to come cloÅ¿er or more Home to Å¿uch things as will be immediately neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be known by all, that would avoid being ImpoÅ¿ed on or Å¿lyly cheated of their SenÅ¿es, in too fondly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the InÅ¿inuating Flateries of Å¿uch as labour with both hands to pull down a Å¿peedy Ruin on them.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Flattery and InÅ¿inuations by <hi>Town-Shifts, Sharpers, Sharks,</hi> &amp;c. to work upon the Humours, PaÅ¿Å¿ions of the Mind, Inclinations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Younger, to bring about their pernicious DeÅ¿igns; with Å¿ome AlluÅ¿ions, and apt Stories, by way of Caution.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Task I have undertaken is Å¿o difficult, and the PerÅ¿ons I am about to deÅ¿cribe Å¿o many, their Ways, Practices and Vices Å¿o various, though they all concenter in one main DeÅ¿ign to ruin Youth, that I cannot but fancy, my Young Reader upon firÅ¿t fight will conclude I have enterprized an ImpoÅ¿Å¿ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; or, that to be performed effectually by any Å¿ingle PerÅ¿on, it may appear a <hi>Herculean.</hi> Labour; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, let none be Å¿o incredulous as to doubt, but when it is read over, it will anÅ¿wer, if Å¿eriouÅ¿ly weighted and revolved in the Mind, the niceÅ¿t Expectation.</p>
               <p>In the firÅ¿t place then, it is the Care and InduÅ¿try of Å¿uch as deÅ¿ign to deceive and betray Youth, to find a way to Å¿lide unto their Acquaintance, and when that is a little Å¿etled, to inÅ¿inuate themÅ¿elves into their Affections, Å¿tudying the Bent and PaÅ¿Å¿ions of their Inclinations, which thoÅ¿e that are well ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed in the Art of deceiving, will Å¿hrewdly gueÅ¿s at, by the Complexion of Party: then they flatter them with all the Endearments of reÅ¿pect and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial KindneÅ¿s, Å¿eeming afflicted when they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and to rejoyce when they have any tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of that PleaÅ¿ing PaÅ¿Å¿ion; Å¿etting a GloÅ¿s even upon their Faults and Failings, wrong naming their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35213:4"/>Vices, and clouding them under the appearances of Virtue; calling Pride a Genteel Mien and gallantry of an Exalted Spirit; Prodigality the effect of a Generous Mind; deÅ¿ires of Revenge, Courage and an uncontroulable Magnanimity; DrunnkenneÅ¿s Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and an agreeable Companion; and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, they want not flattery to gild them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and make them look lovely in the conceit of Unthinking Youth who for the moÅ¿t part has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Enemy to aid theÅ¿e Sycophants, <hi>viz.</hi> Self-flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, a ThirÅ¿t of PraiÅ¿e, and deÅ¿ire to be EÅ¿teemed: and by theÅ¿e, and the like means, like Å¿ubtil Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents they wind themÅ¿elves into the BoÅ¿om, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of thoÅ¿e they intend to prey upon; and get Å¿uch Credit with the parties, that the good advice of real Friends is moÅ¿tly abortive, in labouring to open the Eyes of the Infatuated, that they may Å¿ee, and purge out the Å¿preading Bane, by timely Remi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies e'er it grows mortal. Flattery, as I Å¿aid, is their main Engin to make the firÅ¿t Breach, and make a way for them to enter. If theÅ¿e deceivers perceive a PerÅ¿on Cholerick, Å¿ubject to Quarrel and Revenge, as naturally prompted to it by that fiery Humour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominating in the ConÅ¿titution, when they hear him complain of wrongs or Injuries, though perhaps himÅ¿elf has been the AggreÅ¿Å¿or, they preÅ¿ently Å¿trike in to Å¿well his Wrath, and cauÅ¿e the fluctuating Ocean of his Indignation to riÅ¿e, toÅ¿Å¿ing him with a TempeÅ¿t of bitter Inuectives againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that have put him out of Humour, magnifying the TruÅ¿t he has in them, to let them know his grievance; vowing with horrid imprecations to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t him at the hazard of their Lives in his juÅ¿t Revenge; but when they have born up his Courage, or rather Rage to a pitch, it there be any evident Danger in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35213:5"/>the Enterprize, then they Å¿hrink from him, leaving him in the Broil; which Å¿ometimes coÅ¿ts him his Life, or at leaÅ¿t much Trouble. Yet for this coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forÅ¿aking, they have Å¿o many plauÅ¿ible ExcuÅ¿es, as IndiÅ¿poÅ¿ition, Å¿udden LameneÅ¿s, Å¿eeing Bailiffs waiting to arreÅ¿t them, whoÅ¿e troubleÅ¿om preÅ¿ence they were conÅ¿trained to avoid; vowing not the fear of Sacrificing Life, Å¿hould other ways have hindred them in the Enterprize; and ExpreÅ¿Å¿ing Å¿uch a world of Sorrow for their remiÅ¿sneÅ¿s to Å¿o dear a Friend; that after Å¿ome Words paÅ¿Å¿ing, the Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon Sea appears again, and they Å¿ail off Å¿moothly on his Affections, as before: For theÅ¿e indeed are a Cowardly Generation, more for BluÅ¿tring, NoiÅ¿e and Talk than Blows; and many a one, for relying on them to back him, has fallen into Å¿trange and dangerous Misfortunes; for they are but Reeds, and whoever leans on them for Support, they break, and pierce his hand.</p>

                  <p>A lively Character of a Gentile <hi>Town-Shift,</hi> with the Stratagems, Policies and Devices he uÅ¿es, to get into the Acquaintance of Young <hi>Country-Gentlemen;</hi> and others; with the Tricks he plays, to Rook them of their Money: and in concluÅ¿ion, to Marry them to Lewd Women of the <hi>Town;</hi> under pretence of their being HeireÅ¿Å¿es, or mighty Fortunes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE <hi>Country-Gentleman,</hi> or one ignorant of the Ways and Tricks of the <hi>Town,</hi> is to conÅ¿ider, that he is to be always on his Guard; and that MiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truÅ¿t and Diffidence are the beÅ¿t Sinews of his Policy: for if he be over-credulous, and eaÅ¿y to be trained into a belief of Å¿eeming Appearances, to believe Things Å¿ubÅ¿tantial, when they are only Shadows; he lays himÅ¿elf open to many Inconveniencies and Misfortunes: for on this weak Å¿ide he muÅ¿t expect Attacks, that will carry the Fort either by Parley or Storm.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:35213:7"/>
               <p>But before I come to diÅ¿cover how this is done, it will not be amiÅ¿s to give a brief Character of the moÅ¿t dangerous Enemy, that under a cloaked and diÅ¿Å¿embled FriendÅ¿hip, will (if he meets him, or finds, for that he will certainly do, if he knows or hears of him, an opportunity to get into his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and Å¿crape acquaintance with him) lay him on board; Å¿hewing firÅ¿t falÅ¿e Colours, to hale and allure him into his Power; and declares himÅ¿elf, or at leaÅ¿t by Å¿ad Experience is found to be a Pirate, making his Fortunes by the Ruins of his Prize.</p>
               <p>He is by Å¿ome called a <hi>Town-Gallant,</hi> but more vulgarly known by the Epithet of the <hi>Gentile Town-Shift,</hi> often Å¿hifting and changing his Cloathes and Lodging; for he deÅ¿ires as little to be known, as inquired after. He has been well educated, having Å¿omething of the Education of a Gentleman, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Fortune; his Father by his riotous way of living, having left him no other Portion than the wide World to live in: and he remembring Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his Gentility, cannot be forced, even by pinching NeceÅ¿Å¿ity, to undertake any induÅ¿trious, lawful Employment; leÅ¿t he Å¿hould Å¿tain, as he pretends, the Reputation of his Family. He has been himÅ¿elf bubbled, and concludes it no Sin to Å¿et up, and practiÅ¿e it on others: and to perfect him Å¿o to do, and live on their Spoils, he makes it his BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s to gain Experience; by Travelling abroad in the company of Å¿ome young Gentlemen, who bear his Charges; that he may Å¿eaÅ¿on himÅ¿elf with a Å¿mattering of Forein Languages, learn the alamode Shrug-cringe, and Å¿ome other Mimick Deportments.

Lip of the tempting Sex, and this he concludes his ParadiÅ¿e; Å¿uppoÅ¿ing Hell to be no more than a Hot-houÅ¿e, to Flux for a Clap; denying there is an eÅ¿Å¿ential difference between Good and Evil: deems ConÅ¿cience only a thing fit for Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Å¿tiling the Devil the ParÅ¿on's Bugbear, and the civil Gentleman in black; aÅ¿cribing good Morals and honeÅ¿t Dealing to Simplicity, and a Å¿tupid Ignorance in the Facetious Humors and Ways of the <hi>Town.</hi> Yet, as I have in the former Chapter hinted, he can act variouÅ¿ly, to comply with the different Humors of thoÅ¿e he deÅ¿igns to prey on.</p>
               <p>And having thus briefly given you his Character, I come now to his Practice; DiÅ¿Å¿imulation, Flattery, Patience, feigned Humility, Affability, Civility, and PlauÅ¿ibility, are the Weapons he charges with, as he Å¿ees occaÅ¿ion.</p>
               <p>He is acquainted much at Inns, and often rides Å¿ome Miles out of Town, to view the Stage-Coaches as they come to <hi>London;</hi> and if he Å¿ees any young Gentleman he can put-upon, he rides near, or within Å¿ight of the Coach, 'till it comes to it, proper Stage; Å¿ets up in the Å¿ame Inn, where the Chamberlain, TapÅ¿ter and HoÅ¿tler, and all the Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticks give him great ReÅ¿pect, with worÅ¿hipful
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35213:8"/>Titles; becauÅ¿e he is bountiful to them, for their particular Services, in learning of the Coach-man the Gentleman's Name, the Place from whence he came, that of his Birth, his Quality, and the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion that brought him to Town; but moÅ¿t of all the Å¿trength of his PurÅ¿e; and what elÅ¿e can conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently be known. This done, he finds an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to inÅ¿inuate himÅ¿elf into his company, by doing him Å¿ome little piece of Service; upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of being alone, and a Stranger, deÅ¿irous of Company, and particularly of his; proteÅ¿ting, after Å¿ome Å¿mall introductory DiÅ¿courÅ¿e of Complimenting and Cringing, that his PhyÅ¿iognomy takes him extreamly, that he Å¿ees much Gallantry in it, manly and brave, frank and generous; proteÅ¿ting he is wholly engaged to Å¿erve him; then binds it with an Oath, that if he had the Honour to be known to him, he is a Man Å¿incere, and an utter Enemy to Flattery; though at the Å¿ame time all is notorious Flattery, that he may wind himÅ¿elf into his good Opinion, on purpoÅ¿e to deceive and betray him: and when he perceives he has wrought him Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his purpoÅ¿e, the better to confirm him in his feigned Sincerity, he changes the DiÅ¿courÅ¿e after two or three GlaÅ¿Å¿es have paÅ¿Å¿ed, and to wheedle an acquaintance with him, tho' he never Å¿et Eyes on him before: for fixing his Eyes upon him, and gazing Å¿tedfaÅ¿tly, as if Å¿ome Apparition preÅ¿ented it Å¿elf, he falls back in a Å¿tart; Å¿aying, Ha! who is this I Å¿ee? O that I Å¿hould be thus long blinded! What my deareÅ¿t Friend, and I not know him all the while? When the Gentleman pauÅ¿es, and wonders at this; and can by no means call to mind he ever Å¿aw his Face before; he calls him by his Name, and tells the Place of his Birth or Abode, as he had learned it in the Inn before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand;

It's Å¿trange, that in Å¿o Å¿hort a time you Å¿hould forget one that profeÅ¿Å¿es himÅ¿elf the greateÅ¿t Friend and Servant to your Family, of any Man living. Pardon me Sir, Å¿ays the Gentleman, that I cannot Å¿o readily call you to mind, for I do not at preÅ¿ent remember I ever Å¿aw you before. That's very Å¿trange indeed, replyes he, there's Å¿carce one of your Family that I do not know, as well as I know you: when I lived at <hi>D</hi> â€” there was no doing without me, I was always among them, I had the honour to Å¿ee you there almoÅ¿t every day, Pray' how do you call the Place at <hi>D</hi> â€”, where they uÅ¿ed to walk under cool refreÅ¿hing Shades in the Summer-Evenings?

Well, replys the <hi>Sharper,</hi> there are a hundred things a Man I Å¿ee may forget, but no matter, let us em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and renew our former Acquaintance. This makes the poor Gentleman wonder, and recollect himÅ¿elf all he can: when our <hi>Town-Shift</hi> perceiving him pauÅ¿ing, and at a Å¿tand, as half-wrought into a belief of what he had Å¿aid, thus proceeds to give the finiÅ¿hing-Å¿troak.

Alack alack! Å¿ays he, that I Å¿hould Å¿o miÅ¿take, it was directly Å¿he I meant; if I miÅ¿take not, Å¿he was your Father's SiÅ¿ter.

If other Means fail, the next place is a Tavern; where out <hi>Town-Shift</hi> being well known, is received, and attended with Titles of Honour, and much Å¿eeming ReÅ¿pect, by the Vintner, his Wife, Daughter, and Drawers: and the rather, becauÅ¿e at his firÅ¿t approaching the Bar, and demanding whether My Lord, or Sir <hi>William</hi> Such a one had been there to aÅ¿k for him, he Tipt them the Wink or Sign, that he had brought a Bubble with him; which made them conclude, they were likely to reap a Share of the Profit he intended to make of him.</p>
               <p>A Bottle or two paÅ¿Å¿ing, and it growing late, they, take Coach again, and to our <hi>Shift</hi>'s Lodging, tho' perhaps but a few Doors diÅ¿tant; the Matron of the HouÅ¿e receives him with genteel Welcoms, and a profound Civility; the Servants imitate her in every thing, as knowing they Å¿hall be no loÅ¿ers by it. And tho' our <hi>Shift</hi> before lay in a Garret to Å¿ave Charges, now the beÅ¿t Chamber is made ready, and

               <p>Next morning, to keep up the Conceit of this Fatal FriendÅ¿hip, a Collation is prepared, and a She pretended CoÅ¿in comes, in very gawdy TinÅ¿il Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, ModiÅ¿h, and appearingly very Rich; aÅ¿ks for our <hi>Town-Shift,</hi> by the Title of Sir <hi>William,</hi> or Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> deÅ¿iring of the Landlady to know, if he be yet Å¿tirring; if not, that Å¿he would not diÅ¿turb his WorÅ¿hip: for Å¿he is going to their Aunts, Madam Å¿uch a one, and will call again as Å¿he returns.

But the pretended CoÅ¿in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿es it, urging he knows her BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s; and that if Å¿he diÅ¿patch it not, and return in time, Å¿he will incur the diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure of her Mother; on which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides her preÅ¿ent Fortune that none can hinder her of, depends Å¿ome ThouÅ¿ands of Pounds, which however Å¿he will be Å¿ure of at her Death. If he be an Unmarried Man, this takes to Admiration, and he is Smitten, as we call it, at the firÅ¿t Touch. A Beauty and a Fortune Å¿trangely charm him, and he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35213:11"/>hugs himÅ¿elf in Raptures, to conceit he hath Å¿uch a Friend to facilitate his AddreÅ¿Å¿es, to open the way for his CourtÅ¿hip, and render it eaÅ¿y.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Shifter</hi> perceiving this Bait hath taken to his wiÅ¿h, Å¿oon dives into the Affairs that brought him to Town; what EÅ¿tate he hath, if his Friends be dead, or what he expects, if they be living; and by a kind of an imperceptible inÅ¿inuating, wheedles things out of him in ambiguous terms, 'till he underÅ¿tands his Humours and Affairs, as well, or better than himÅ¿elf.</p>
               <p>And now is the time to Å¿tart his Game, and run it down with all convenient Å¿peed, leÅ¿t Å¿ome unlucky Accident Å¿hould make him loÅ¿e it: as a DiÅ¿covery, the Gentleman's being Å¿uddenly Å¿ent for Home, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, or the like. He pretends, and deÅ¿ires earneÅ¿tly, to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t him in his Affairs, if they urgently preÅ¿s it, that Morning; if not, to Å¿hew him the CurioÅ¿ities of the Court or City.</p>
               <p>But certainly he will be Å¿ure to inveigle him to Dine at an Ordinary; or Å¿uch a place, where he hath, or will by that time Å¿end to Å¿ome of his Accomplices to meet him; to whom he always gives Noble or WorÅ¿hipful Titles, the better to carry on the Intrigue without Å¿uÅ¿picion: and they return his Civility with profound ReÅ¿pect, and bridle in their accuÅ¿tomed Oaths, that they may not be Å¿uÅ¿pected to be what they are; and turn their DiÅ¿courÅ¿e on State-Affairs, or what Sport they had in Hawking, Hunting, and other Genteel Recreations; when they went to ViÅ¿it Å¿uch a Lord or Knight at his Country-Seat. Then every one Salutes the Stranger, and Welcomes him to Town.</p>
               <p>Dinner being ended, they Drink about JuÅ¿tily, impoÅ¿ing on our Country-Gentleman Å¿o many Healths, 'till they perceive his Brains begin to crow, then to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35213:12"/>paÅ¿s away the Tedious Time, as they term it, the Dice are called for; not by his pretended Friend, but by the other Confederates: for he Å¿eems to oppoÅ¿e it, that he may be thought to have no Hand in the Plot.</p>
               <p>When the upÅ¿hot comes, and Å¿o much Money is Å¿eemingly loÅ¿t and won between them, at length our <hi>Town-Shift</hi> Å¿ets in, and Wins prodigiouÅ¿ly, which encourages the Country-Gentleman to Bett, who is Å¿uffered likewiÅ¿e to Win; which, with Å¿ome other Incitements, puts him on to Play himÅ¿elf; and then, as out of courteÅ¿y, his pretended Friend gives him his place, Å¿ome Å¿mall matter he wins; but prompted to Set high, the Dice turn upon him; for they Top and Palm, throwing Dice themÅ¿elves that will run but to the deÅ¿ired Chances; and by the Art of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Then his Friend <hi>Shift</hi> Å¿eems to be diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed that he brought him thither, proteÅ¿ting he was againÅ¿t Playing, and Å¿orry for his croÅ¿s luck; yet bids him not be dejected, though Fortune proves now a Jilt, another time Å¿he may favour him, to recover all with a large addition to boot. This, if he has any Bills to receive Money in Town, brings them out; and their Å¿eeming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneÅ¿s to engage any farther, makes him more eager to go on. His Friend then Betts on his Å¿ide, and he hath Å¿ome little Luck again, but quickly the Tide turns; for they are for Å¿triking whil'Å¿t the Iron is hot, and all is daÅ¿ht again. This vexes him Å¿o, that off comes the Diamond-Ring, and out comes the Watch; but here his Friend Å¿tops him, for he has a mind theÅ¿e Å¿hould be beÅ¿towed elÅ¿ewhere:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35213:12"/>and then the others knowing the meaning of it, Å¿neak out one by one, pay at the Bar, and rub-off, leaving him and Mr. <hi>

This, and two or three briÅ¿k GlaÅ¿Å¿es, put him out of his dumps; and a Scrivener being Å¿ent for, 'tis accepted with thankfulneÅ¿s, on the Terms propounded: which Civility, and others formerly received, obliges him to Pay the Shot for them both, and be liberal to the Servants.</p>
               <p>Hereupon a Coach is called, and away to Airing they go to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, or <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> if Å¿eaÅ¿onable; if not, to the <hi>Tennis-Court,</hi> or to take a view of the Tombs at <hi>WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter:</hi> but where-ever it is, as the Plot was laid in the Morning, they meet the She-CoÅ¿in with her Footman at her tail; this Å¿eems to the Gentleman, as by wonderful accident; and Å¿o Å¿he proteÅ¿ts, the better to confirm him in his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of her little deÅ¿ire to go, or be Å¿een abroad.</p>
               <p>The renovation of this charming Sight joÅ¿tles all thoughts of his LoÅ¿Å¿es out of his Head, and after a turn or two, where muÅ¿t they go but to the Play-HouÅ¿e. Our <hi>Town-Shift</hi> Å¿tarts this, and Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elle with much Å¿eeming ModeÅ¿ty declines it; urging, Å¿he cannot Å¿pare Time; or that the Age is Å¿o cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿orious and Å¿candalous, that it is not a Place conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for her to be Å¿een in.</p>
               <p>Her coldneÅ¿s maks the young Gentleman importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and our <hi>Town-Shift</hi> backs him in it, joining his PerÅ¿waÅ¿ion; Å¿o that at length it is agreed on, and away they are jolted together.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman, who never Å¿aw Å¿uch fine things before, is mightily taken, and vows, the PleaÅ¿ures of the Town as far exceed thoÅ¿e of the Country,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35213:13"/>as he fancies <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s ParadiÅ¿e exceeds the DeÅ¿arts of <hi>Arabia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Play ended, they are obliged to Å¿ee her home to her Apartment; and then, as a lucky hit would have it, the Lady-Mother talked on before, (there being no Å¿uch living Creature) is feigned to be at Å¿uch a Ladies Labour, or gone to Å¿ee Å¿ome Å¿ick CounteÅ¿s.</p>
               <p>So that here the Eatertainment interrupted, is Splendid at the CoÅ¿t of our young Gentleman; who in GeneroÅ¿ity, having at Å¿uch Charge learned thus much of Town-Breeding, muÅ¿t Treat the Lady, in recompence of the Favour her Company hath (in complaiÅ¿ance to his RequeÅ¿ts) obliged him with.</p>
               <p>Her Acceptance emboldens him to talk Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouÅ¿ly, but Å¿he Å¿eems not to underÅ¿tand him, and inÅ¿tead of returning his Glances, fixes her Eyes on his Diamond-Ring, proceeding to praiÅ¿e the beauty and Å¿plendor of it; Å¿aying, Å¿he once had juÅ¿t Å¿uch another, preÅ¿ented her by a PerÅ¿on of Honour, but hath loÅ¿t it; and to this day dares not let her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know Å¿o much. You told me CoÅ¿in, continues Å¿he, directing her DiÅ¿courÅ¿e to our <hi>Town-Shift,</hi> that you would Å¿peak to the Jeweller, that made it for the Lady who preÅ¿ented it me, for Å¿uch another; as for the Price, I will not Å¿tand with him. Truly CoÅ¿in, replied he, I forgot to tell you, I was with the Man I thought had made it, but it proves a MiÅ¿take, he did not, nor can he inform me who did. I am Å¿orry for that, Å¿ays Å¿he, but I fancy this Gentleman's is extream like it; yet ModeÅ¿ty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids me to be Å¿o rude, as to deÅ¿ire a Stranger to truÅ¿t me with Å¿uch a value, for a Pattern.</p>
               <p>Our Gentleman, who all this while hath liÅ¿tned to this charming <hi>Syren,</hi> like a Nightingal to a Flajolet, mightily taken with her Carriage, thinks now he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35213:13"/>hath an Opportunity Å¿ubÅ¿tantially to oblige Å¿o Å¿weet a Creature, as he Å¿uppoÅ¿es her; and if he be not Married, makes one great Step to gain her, and her prodigious Fortunes in the Clouds; prompted by Mr. <hi>Shift</hi> with Nods and Winks, makes no Å¿cruple, not to lend it her, but preÅ¿ents it as his Act and Deed; which Å¿he Å¿eems in ModeÅ¿ty to refuÅ¿e, 'till he in a manner is compelled to force that upon her, which Å¿he Å¿o earneÅ¿tly deÅ¿ires; and muÅ¿t, as our <hi>Shift</hi> whiÅ¿pers in his Ear, take it as a Favour that Å¿he will accept it.</p>
               <p>This makes her look with more gracious Eyes upon him; Å¿o that having found the Fruits of the firÅ¿t PreÅ¿ent, his Gold-Watch goes next; and he plyes her with many others, to Å¿peak more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for him than his Rhetorick can do.</p>
               <p>To be brief, he Å¿o prevails at laÅ¿t, that Å¿he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ents he Å¿hall Steal her, but not 'till a good Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made. The Management of the BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s is left to our <hi>Town-Shift,</hi> who is gratified with Gold, fringed Gloves, and other coÅ¿tly things, on the Wedding-Day; the Marriage being celebrated very privately.</p>
               <p>This done, he hath Å¿carce time to Embrace his charming Bride, whom he finds the firÅ¿t Night but a crackt Bargain, if he Å¿cape a Clap; ere her Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, Tally-man, Landlady, Silk-man, Lace-man, Draper, Shooe-maker, Tire-woman, and a Shoal more Å¿urround him at his Å¿etting forth from his Chamber, with their Bills, and clamour for the Money his Bride owes them. And this he muÅ¿t take as a Civility; for Å¿ometimes two or three couple of Harpy-Catchpoles Å¿eize him at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Stairs.</p>
               <p>In fine, his pretended Friend Mr. <hi>Shift</hi> hath now plaid his Prank, and is withdrawn to Å¿hare the Booty
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35213:14"/>with the GameÅ¿ters. And he hears no more of him but for the Money he lent him. Upon Enquiry, hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Her feigned ModeÅ¿ty now is vaniÅ¿hed, and if he dares upbraid her with the Misfortune that hath befallen him, Å¿he twits him with his Folly and Ignorance in the Ways of the Town, roars, Å¿lings and rants like any Bedlam; and Swears now Å¿he is Wife, Å¿he will make him know his Driver; a Coach Å¿he will have, and Freedom at all times.</p>
               <p>CoÅ¿in <hi>Shift</hi> is Å¿till her Gallant, and goes Snips with her in all Å¿he can rook her deceived HuÅ¿band of; who to keep her quiet, and the Misfortune as huÅ¿h as may be among his Relations in the Country; to Å¿upply her LuÅ¿t, Luxury, Pride, and other Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ives, firÅ¿t Mortgages, then Sells outright, after runs in Debt; and if his Heart be Å¿o Å¿trong as not quickly to break with theÅ¿e Afflictions, he may linger out Å¿ome Years in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> or <hi>Fleet,</hi> or flying a Gaol, meet with as bad Misfortunes in a Forein Land. As for his Wife, Å¿he is Å¿till in her Element, nay hath bettered his Fortunes by a ReÅ¿erve; and when grown Old, Å¿he knows the worÅ¿t of it; if Poverty compels her, 'tis but to turn Bawd or Procurer.</p>
               <p>As for her Original, Å¿he was the Cub of a Bumpkin, licked into Å¿hape, Å¿ent up to <hi>London</hi> in a Green WaÅ¿tcoat and Red Peticoat, to be thrown on the Care of Fortune; from a CloÅ¿eÅ¿toole-Emptier, Å¿he riÅ¿es to be a Cook-Maid, from thence, crept up Stairs to manage the Bedding and Carpets; in which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35213:14"/>Station growing Å¿pruce, and Nature having endued her with a tolerable Face, and a large Stock of Confidence Å¿he was Boarded a-Å¿tern by the young 'Squire her MaÅ¿ter's Son; when complaining to him that her Belly wambled, he put her off with a piece of Money: upon which, Å¿he took Sanctuary under the Protection of an old Bawdy Midwife, who having delivered her, and dropt the Child as a PariÅ¿h-Charge, adviÅ¿ed her to turn Town-Woman, or a Woman of the Town; and taught her how to practiÅ¿e, going Snips with her for CounÅ¿el. But often meeting with Affronts, to Å¿kreen her againÅ¿t them, Å¿he choÅ¿e our <hi>Town-Shift</hi> for her Bully; who brought her CuÅ¿tomers, and went Å¿hare in the Profit.</p>
               <p>I might enlarge much more on this, but having many things to treat of before I finiÅ¿h this Å¿mall Book; I muÅ¿t intreat the Reader not to expect too large a Birth in the beginning; leÅ¿t the Å¿ubÅ¿equent Relations prove but Pigmeys, for want of room, to grow to their deÅ¿ired Stature.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A <hi>Town-Shark,</hi> his lively Character. How he falls into the Acquaintance of Young <hi>Shopkeepers,</hi> by what Artifices he works his own Advantage, to bring them to Ruin. As alÅ¿o their Female Relations; and how in their Extremity, he practiÅ¿es greater Villanies againÅ¿t them: and other things, well worth noting.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN this Chapter, Young Men that by the help of Friends, or their own InduÅ¿try, Set up, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to make a Figure in the World, my Precautions are directed to you. For beÅ¿ides Beaus and Fops, that will be apt to Wheedle you abroad, to make you neglect your BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s, loyter away your Time, Å¿pend your Money, and endanger your Credit and Reputation.</p>
               <p>There lurks behind the Curtain a more peÅ¿tilent Enemy to your Fortunes, who makes it his whole Study and BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s to nip them in their growth. Nor ought the Larks to cour, and be more afraid of the Hobby, who makes it his work to prey upon them, than Young Men adventuring on the Stage of Worldly Affairs, ought to conÅ¿ider how they may Å¿hun meeting with this <hi>Hyena</hi> in Human Å¿hape. And that he may be the better known, and avoided, I Å¿hall firÅ¿t briefly deÅ¿cribe him, and Å¿o proceed to his Practices.</p>
               <p>He goes under many Denominations, which I Å¿hall not trouble my Å¿elf to enumerate, but trace him in the vulgarly known Epithet of a <hi>Town-Shark.</hi> He boaÅ¿ts himÅ¿elf of his Parentage, and what a great EÅ¿tate they had, but were Ruined for their Loyal Adherence to the Royal Family, in the late
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35213:15"/>Civil War: though the truth is, like a <hi>Chedder</hi>-CheeÅ¿e, the whole Milk of the PariÅ¿h went towards making, or rather educating him. For his tender Mother, weary of a Burden Å¿he knew not where to find a Father for, dropt, and left him as a PariÅ¿h-Charge.</p>
               <p>However, growing up, the Charity of the Church-Wardens and OverÅ¿eers enabled him with a Smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of FreeÅ¿chool-Learning: but his early Rogueries making the MaÅ¿ter weary of him, he is turned out before he could term himÅ¿elf a Proficient in it, and threatned with the dreadful Drudgery of keeping Sheep, or feeding Swine; the LazineÅ¿s of his Parentage being inherent, and cauÅ¿ing in him an averÅ¿ion to any thing that look'd like Labour; he to the Satisfaction of his Benefactors, gave them the Å¿lip, and trudges on bare Ten-toes, as the old Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, to <hi>London,</hi> the common Receptacle or Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous of Vagrants; where rambling about the other end of the Town, pennileÅ¿s, and almoÅ¿t Å¿tarved; his kind Stars at length favour him Å¿o far, that he gets a Lodging in a Gentleman's Stable, and is entertained by a lazy Coachman to rub down and feed his HorÅ¿es. From thence he riÅ¿es, to run of Errands for the Maid-Servants; who commending him for his InduÅ¿try to their MaÅ¿ter, time offering a vacancy, he is preferred to the dignity of a Foot-Man.</p>
               <p>And here he practiÅ¿eth to Å¿et up for himÅ¿elf, by learning to underÅ¿tand a Dey well, by often Playing with his Livery-Companions, Laced-Coat-GameÅ¿ters: nay even his nightly Dreams are tending to it, <hi>viz. Come at Seven,</hi> is often heard in his Sleep; and his Morning-Å¿tudy is, what Chance of the Dey is Å¿ooneÅ¿t thrown, in topping, Å¿lurring, palming, napping, and how to fix a Dey for any purpoÅ¿e.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:35213:16"/>
               <p>The next advance he makes, is to play on the Flajolet, Flute, Hautboy, or Violin; and for his Teaching, his MaÅ¿ter's Bottles of Wine, Ale, Cyder, or Legs of Capons, moÅ¿tly pay, as he can filch them. And if he has any tolerable Voice, he learns to Sing Å¿omething tuneable, by imitating in the Upper Gallery at the Play-HouÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e AccompliÅ¿hments make the Cook-Maid fall in Love with him, and over-enamoured with his queint DiÅ¿courÅ¿e, Shape and Features, truÅ¿ts him before-hand with her Secrets, communicating Å¿o long, 'till her Belly begins to wamble; he all this while promiÅ¿ing her Marriage, not Å¿crupling to bind it with Oaths and Imprecations: Å¿o that the Å¿illy good-natured Wench believing all he Å¿ays to be GoÅ¿pel, crams into his Hand the Money Å¿he hath laid up, Å¿aved out of her Wages and Veils, to buy him a new Suit of Cloaths, a Wedding-Ring, and other Furniture; for the Day is appointed: with this making up his Pack, he rubs off, leaving her in Cares and Tears, to bewail her fond EaÅ¿ineÅ¿s and Credulity.</p>
               <p>The firÅ¿t thing after this is, like a Snake, to caÅ¿t his Skin of a Livery, and to put himÅ¿elf with his own, and poor GreaÅ¿y-buttocks Money, into a Gentile Sute; diÅ¿guiÅ¿ing himÅ¿elf with a long Wig, and clapping on a faÅ¿hionable Sword. And Å¿o being a little tutored, and better grounded by Å¿ome Å¿ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oned Sticks, into whoÅ¿e company he thruÅ¿ts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, or is introduced, he Å¿ets up for a Proficient in this DeÅ¿tructive Calling. And now as to his Practice.</p>
               <p>O' Nights he is moÅ¿tly waking, to Å¿tudy Devices, that he may put them in practice in the Day; and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up in the Morning, traces the Streets more than a Penny-PoÅ¿t-Letter-Carrier, caÅ¿ting his Eyes on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35213:16"/>Both Å¿ides the way, to Å¿py and mark out his Game. BeÅ¿ide, he hath intelligencers abroad, who give him notice what Young Men are newly Set up, and what they Å¿uppoÅ¿e their Stocks and other Fortunes to be: and when he hath pitched upon any one that he may gather from his DiÅ¿eourÅ¿e, what Temper he is of, Å¿eeing him alone, he Å¿teps in, and with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiÅ¿ant Demeanour, intreats to borrow a Pen and Ink to write a few words; and then generouÅ¿ly he draws a Bill for a good Summ, on Å¿ome unknown PerÅ¿on: then leaving it careleÅ¿ly, that the young Man may caÅ¿t his Eye on it, deÅ¿ires his Sand-Box, which whil'Å¿t he is reaching, he begins to him a Line or two of Å¿ome Play-Song: then preÅ¿ently leaving off, as if he had done amiÅ¿s, in forgetting the place where he was; I beg your Pardon, Sir, Å¿ay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And to prolong the DiÅ¿courÅ¿e, the better to feel his PulÅ¿e, if any thing of little Price be Å¿old in the Shop, he will lay out a Å¿mall trifling matter; the better to ingratiate himÅ¿elf, when he makes the Å¿econd Attack.</p>
               <p>And Å¿o at this time, with much Civility he takes his leave. And if he finds the Shopkeeper of an eaÅ¿y temper, from this Interview he RegiÅ¿ters him in his Pocket-Book, amongÅ¿t his Culleys he intends to Bite. For thought he will not be Å¿o raÅ¿h the firÅ¿t time, as to aÅ¿k him his Name, leÅ¿t it may create Å¿ome Å¿uÅ¿picion of his DeÅ¿ign.</p>
               <p>Knowing the Sign and Trade, he fails not to Å¿end another to inquire it in the Neighbourhood, that he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35213:17"/>may have it ready at his Tongues-end the next Attack he makes; and in the mean while, a Flute, or Å¿ome Å¿uch InÅ¿trument is by his order left for him, by a Boy in a Green Apron, purpoÅ¿ely dreÅ¿t up and Å¿ent. And if at firÅ¿t the young Shopkeeper Å¿cruple to take it in, as proteÅ¿ting he knows no Å¿uch Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by Name, and believes he is miÅ¿taken in the HouÅ¿e; the arch Knave has it at his fingers ends, by the Å¿ame Token he was there Å¿uch a Day, and bought Å¿uch Things: then he is remembred, and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. About an Hour or two after, he comes ratling in a Coach, the better to credit him. If he Å¿ees the young Man buÅ¿y, or engaged in his Shop with Company, he paÅ¿Å¿es by, and takes him in his return. If not, he puts out his Head and poudered Wig, bawling to the Coachman to Å¿top: and boldly going in, and with a ModiÅ¿h Cringe and Air, aÅ¿ks if he has not been troubleÅ¿om to him, in taking the boldneÅ¿s to order Å¿omething to be left for him; which he had not attempted, had it been finiÅ¿hed when he called at the Shop where he bought it, and this Place lying more directly in his way.</p>
               <p>The young Man hearing him make Å¿uch a Scruple for a Trifle, as he Å¿uppoÅ¿es, not perceiving the Snake in the GraÅ¿s, tells him he is welcom now, and at any time, to Å¿end or cauÅ¿e to be left any thing at his Shop, and it Å¿hall be laid up Å¿afely for him.</p>
               <p>Why, Å¿ays he, living at t'other end of the Town, I may with your good leave, make bold now and then to trouble you. But pray' Sir, continues he, for this KindneÅ¿s, and to confirm our better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; which if it lies in my power, Å¿hall be to your Advantage; Suffer me to preÅ¿ent you with a GlaÅ¿s of Wine.</p>
               <p>The young Man perhaps at firÅ¿t Å¿eems coy, or pretends that he has Å¿ome that he inÅ¿tantly expects,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35213:17"/>about BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s. But he preÅ¿Å¿es it with Å¿uch a Facetious Air, Mein, and Å¿eeming GeneroÅ¿ity, that he verily believes him to be of Quality: and that in doing it, he may both oblige a Gentleman, and Å¿uch a one as he may probably expect to be a CuÅ¿tomer to him; or at leaÅ¿t engage others of his Acquaintance to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage him that way.</p>
               <p>Then if there be no Apprentice, or he be out of the way, the Maid, SiÅ¿ter, or Å¿ome other is called down, to look to the Shop, 'till he Å¿teps a little way with the Gentleman. When entring the Tavern, and a Room being Å¿hewn, there is great Å¿training in CourteÅ¿y, who Å¿hall Å¿peak for the Wine; that it may be known what Å¿ort beÅ¿t gratifies the Palate. And Å¿eeing our Shopkeeper, who expects to be Treated, is Å¿o mannerly that he will not look a Gift-HorÅ¿e in the Mouth; his Å¿uppoÅ¿ed Gentleman, that he may be Å¿ure to hit right, calls for one Pint of White, and another of Red, with <hi>French</hi> Rowls. and after a chirping Cup, he pulls out his Flute, as he fays, to try it; and playing a Tune or two, directly fixes his Eye on our YoungÅ¿ter's Face, to obÅ¿erve how the PaÅ¿Å¿ions agitate the Mind: From whence he gathers, whether he is delighted witls Harmony, or not; if he find he is, he frames a DiÅ¿courÅ¿e of the Rarity of MuÅ¿ick in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where he hath travelled; and that he will, in reÅ¿pect to his good Company Å¿o generouÅ¿ly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him, Å¿ing him a Song he learnt of a <hi>Venetian</hi> Lady; and then confident he underÅ¿tands not <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> tunes his Voice to a certain GibberiÅ¿h, which Å¿ounds melodious enough to an unintelligent Ear, and extorts ApplauÅ¿e from the Auditor.</p>
               <p>And thus in a little time, other diÅ¿courÅ¿e paÅ¿Å¿ing about, they become as intimately acquainted, as if they had Sucked one NurÅ¿e.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:35213:18"/>
               <p>He Å¿tays not long at this time, but calling for the Reckoning, genteely Payes it; thought the other preÅ¿Å¿es at leaÅ¿t to be his Share, in ComplaiÅ¿ance. This makes our Shopkeeper cudgel his Brains, in Å¿tudying as he goes to Å¿ee him take Coach, how he may retaliate the KindneÅ¿s of Å¿o Å¿weet a Gentleman, and can think of none, but the old way, of Sir, Will you pleaÅ¿e when you come this way, or to any place near my HouÅ¿e, to come and Dine with me; I'll promiÅ¿e you Å¿hall be heartily welcom to Å¿uch as you find; and if I certainly knew the time, I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Å¿omething better than ordinary.</p>
               <p>To this he makes Å¿eemingly modeÅ¿t ExcuÅ¿es, as nnwilling to trouble him, 'till it is in his power to oblige him in Å¿omething that may deÅ¿erve it: which cauÅ¿es the other to preÅ¿s it the more, 'till he promiÅ¿e at one time or other to wait on him: but withal, charges him that he get nothing extraordinary when he comes, for he is not over-curious in his Diet: and vows, if he does, it will bar him from treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿ing for the future. And thus, with Å¿ome Ceremony, they part.</p>
               <p>The Ice being now thorowly broken, he does indeed muÅ¿ter up Å¿ome of his Raggamuffin-Acquaintance, that recommended in his Name, (for he the laft Meeting left it with him) prove now and then Retale-CuÅ¿tomers; that gaining a good Opinion for their ready Money, by degrees they may in the cloÅ¿e come into Credit for a full Sweep by WholeÅ¿ale: But theÅ¿e are moÅ¿tly Women, for there are many of his Intriguing-Companions he dare not truÅ¿t; leÅ¿t being more cunning at Intrigue, they Å¿hould Å¿trike-in and wipe his NoÅ¿e: Å¿ome few indeed he muÅ¿t, to carry on the DeÅ¿ign.</p>
               <p>And thus having laid a Foundation of Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance on the Sand, for our young Shopkeeper; and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35213:18"/>on a Rock for his own Advantage; he fails not to come about Dinner-time, that being introduced as a Familiar, he may the better diÅ¿cover the HouÅ¿e, Å¿ee how it is furniÅ¿hed; and from thence take his MeaÅ¿ures, when he comes upon the Borrowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>account. For many times aÅ¿king for a Summ too high, and above the PerÅ¿on's ability that is required to lend it, daÅ¿her all; nay perhaps there may be a SiÅ¿ter or CoÅ¿in, belonging to the HouÅ¿e, whoÅ¿e Portions are at their diÅ¿poÅ¿al: and then if he finds them any thing eaÅ¿y to Å¿wallow his deceitful Baits, he concludes his Advantage double. After Dinner he will Å¿end for a Bottle or two, if his Stock will bear it; and then falls to talking, what a fine <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy</hi> or <hi>Comedy</hi> is to be Acted in the Evening, what curious Scenes or Singing they afford, for the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿ement of the Spectators and Auditors. By theÅ¿e and Å¿uch-like DiÅ¿courÅ¿es, he finds our Young Man's Inclinations; and if he can, he will fix a Play upon him, to draw him farther from home, that he may be out of Call, and more in his power to practiÅ¿e on: for this is one he means to wean by degrees from his Shop, and when he is given to ramble, he is Å¿ure to have him at his Beck.</p>
               <p>The Play ended, after long Å¿itting with dry Lips, they muÅ¿t take a GlaÅ¿s at the Tavern, and it muÅ¿t be where Mr. <hi>Sherk</hi> is intimately acquainted; where the ReÅ¿pect given him, in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Gain, far Å¿urmounts his Quality, thought it adds to the EÅ¿teem already conceived-of him by our Shopkeeper here. As by accident, he purpoÅ¿ely Å¿tumbles on one or two of his Companions, and they muÅ¿t be of the Company, placed at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance one from another; and a GlaÅ¿s for two turned off, he deÅ¿ires them to take farther acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with this Gentleman his Friend, who is newly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35213:19"/>Å¿et up of Å¿uch a Trade, and if they can, aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t a Young Man in his Way; he lays his Obligation on them to do it for his Å¿ake; vowing he is the moÅ¿t obliging, civil Gentleman he ever converÅ¿ed withal; and though but of late acquaintance, he finds that which obliges him to rank him amongÅ¿t the beÅ¿t of his Friends. And goes on farther to praiÅ¿e his InduÅ¿try, Frugality, Good Parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'till the Young Man, though in wardly puffed up with his own PraiÅ¿e, from the Mouth of a flattering Varlet, modeÅ¿tly before Company thinks himÅ¿elf obliged to deÅ¿ire him to deÅ¿iÅ¿t; excuÅ¿ing Å¿o elaborate an <hi>Encomium,</hi> as not due to him; but more worthy to be placed Å¿omewhere elÅ¿e; Å¿alute him, and his Health goes about.</p>
               <p>Thus having Å¿welled him like a Bladder, the next work is to give him Vent; upon a Signal of Å¿o many Knocks or Rings, to call up the Drawer, a PerÅ¿on purpoÅ¿ely planted below takes the Hint, and the Wine carried up, in comes he with a Cloak down to his heels, making his ObeyÅ¿ance to the Company, leaning one Hand at the lower end of the Table, and aÅ¿ks for a Å¿trange Name. In the mean while, he lets go a little Boy he brought concealed under his Cloak, trained up in the dextrous Art of Pick-pocketing from his Infancy. This young Knave crawls to our Citizen unÅ¿een, the Table Å¿heltering him, and by a cleanly Conveyance bites him of his Watch and Money; then returns to his guardian, and is carried out undiÅ¿covered, the Å¿ame way he was brought in; our Shopkeeper, who fits at a diÅ¿tance from any body, not dreaming of any Å¿uch thing.</p>
               <p>After they have gazed upon one another, and aÅ¿ked if any of them know the Man, and all of them affirming No; one whiÅ¿pers to the reÅ¿t, Å¿o loud
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35213:19"/>that our Shop-keeper may hear him, he believes he is a Setter to the Vintner, whoÅ¿e head you broke for making you pay your Reckoning twice; for I heard him Å¿wear he would trounce you for it, and has been enquiring of moÅ¿t of your Friends, what Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern you now uÅ¿e. At this the huffs, and Å¿eems not to value him; however, the Work being done for this time, it gives Å¿ome colour for haÅ¿te to diÅ¿charge the Reckoning, and one without more words, Å¿tepping down to the Bar, the Drawer comes up with Ye'r kindly welcome, Gentlemen, all's paid, and your Friend Å¿tays below, deÅ¿iring you would be pleaÅ¿ed to walk down, which they haÅ¿tily do, and our Shop-keeper follows them with emptyed Pockets, admiring the GeneroÅ¿ity of his new Acquaintance, fondly conceiting a few more of theÅ¿e, would make him a Made Man for ever, if they help him to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tom as they promiÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>He no Å¿ooner parts with them at the Tavern-door, but one altogether a Stanger to him, acts the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Man, and joÅ¿tles him Å¿o, that Å¿omething of a Croud gets about them, but immediately diÅ¿Å¿ipates, and away he goes home: This is to colour the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he Å¿hould verily believe his Pocket was pick'd in the Street: For after he came out of the Play-HouÅ¿e he knew he had his Watch and Money, and in the Tavern, if he Å¿hould be Å¿o ungentile to Å¿uÅ¿pect any of the Company, which Å¿at at diÅ¿tance from him, to do it, as he thinks to himÅ¿elf, his own ReaÅ¿on, convinces him it could not be done; he not Å¿itting near any one by a Yard at leaÅ¿t; for Å¿o they placed themÅ¿elves on purpoÅ¿e, little dreaming of <hi>jack-in-a-Box:</hi> However he is Å¿omewhat dumpiÅ¿h at his loÅ¿s, and when his Å¿uppoÅ¿ed Friend makes him the next ViÅ¿it, he tells him of it, who Å¿eems mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned at Å¿uch a croÅ¿s Accident; and the more,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35213:20"/>becauÅ¿e he occaÅ¿ioned his going abroad, Vowing to make him an equivalent; and Å¿oon confirms his belief of his Pocket being picked after they parted: For as for the Company you were in, I will engage my Life for their Integrity, they are Men of EÅ¿tates, and great Worth; and as for the PerÅ¿on who came in with a frivolous pretence, the whole length of the Table was between you and him.</p>
               <p>This DiÅ¿courÅ¿e palliates the Matter, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes this loÅ¿s, frequent to others, might have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened if he had never gone to the Play-HouÅ¿e; my Money was not very much, Å¿ays he, and as for a Watch, I have a Watch-maker owes me Money, which I believe I Å¿hall not get, unleÅ¿s I hedge it in by taking a Watch for it; and Å¿o that Flaw will be Sodered again.</p>
               <p>However; to drive the Thoughts of this loÅ¿s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond returning again, to make him Melancholy, he begins to diÅ¿courÅ¿e of Poetry, and repeats Å¿ome VerÅ¿es, he has got by heart out of Plays, and if theÅ¿e affect him, out comes a Lampoon, he pretends to have made on a Court-lady, and when he has read it, and Å¿olved the <hi>AEnigmas,</hi> or what is obÅ¿cure in the Hints, he deÅ¿ires him as a choice Friend, to take a Copy of it, which Favour he will allow to no other; And this is to try, if he be Poetically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined; as being aÅ¿Å¿ured, that Poetry behind a Counter, is a certain Mine to blow up Shoop-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For if a Trades-man get the knack of courting the MuÅ¿es, thoÅ¿e jilting jades lead him Å¿uch a Dance that he Å¿oon loÅ¿es himÅ¿elf; for being proud of his paltry Rhymes, he will Å¿eek Company, and at any rate Å¿eek to Herd amongÅ¿t a parcel of Fops and Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foons that call themÅ¿elves Wits, and would be Å¿o Å¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by others. Therefore as a Å¿pecial Note by the way, let all Young-men beware of this Folly, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35213:20"/>Frenzy, that are fixed in any Trade or Calling.</p>
               <p>But to return now, if he be a Å¿ingle Man, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to tickle him with a proÅ¿pect, he has of a fair Fortune for him; if married, he Plows with his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer if it be poÅ¿Å¿ible; and it Å¿hall be hard if he winds not himÅ¿elf in with his Female, and by theÅ¿e Ways and Devices, gaining as it were an abÅ¿olute power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Young-man, he pretends pulling out Å¿everal Bills written by himÅ¿elf, though drawn upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants or Rich Bankers, that he thinks the World declines apace, for he never met with Å¿uch DiÅ¿ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments in his Life; theÅ¿e Bills, Å¿ays he, as you may Å¿ee, are due long Å¿ince, and having layed out Å¿o much money in a PurchaÅ¿e, not in the leaÅ¿t doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I Å¿hould receive this money, it has brought me Å¿omething to a Å¿trait, that I proteÅ¿t I muÅ¿t be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to treÅ¿paÅ¿s upon Å¿ome Friend or other, for a little time. Thus he wheedles, to try his PulÅ¿e this way: Our young Shop-keeper, perhaps at firÅ¿t Å¿eems to pauÅ¿e on the matter, whilÅ¿t <hi>Mr. Shark</hi> keeps his Eyes Å¿tedfaÅ¿tly fixed on him, without Å¿peaking a word; at length the Young-man calling to mind that he had (if he be unmarried) promiÅ¿ed to help him to a conÅ¿iderable Fortune, faintly demands how much will Å¿upply his preÅ¿ent OccaÅ¿ion; he tells him a Å¿lender Å¿um, becauÅ¿e this he intends to pay, that he may Wiredraw him in, for a greater: If he offers to lend it him, he Å¿eems to fly off, Å¿aying, nay Sir, I did not Å¿peak upon that account, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if it will incommode you, Å¿ay Å¿o, and put your Å¿elf to no Å¿traits for me, for I can have it elÅ¿ewhere. You need but tell me, if it will be any Inconveniency to you, to Å¿pare it for a few days; I know Å¿ome will be glad of the occaÅ¿ion to Å¿erve me, but theÅ¿e are Favours only to be aÅ¿ked of Å¿pecial Friends. Nay Sir, Å¿ays the young
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35213:21"/>Shop-keeper, I have Money by me, which is not due to pay, till Å¿uch a time, and it will be little Improvement to me to keep in my Till; therefore pray let me Å¿erve you with the Summ you deÅ¿ire: This is accepted, a Treat given, and punctually pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the time prefixed; but Å¿oon after, upon Å¿uch a pretence, a double Sum or more is laid upon him: And if that way prevails not, then he inviting the young Shop-keeper abroad, in the midÅ¿t of their jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, when he has Drank him to a Pitch, the Drawer comes up, and whiÅ¿pers <hi>Mr. Shark,</hi> that there are three Men enquire for him, and will have no deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but are coming up Stairs; at this, he by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Breath, and Å¿training, forces himÅ¿elf to change Colour, then bites his Lip, and layes his Hand on his Sword; which Å¿uddain alteration, the young man perceiving, earneÅ¿tly enquires into the CauÅ¿e, when with a Å¿igh he replyes, was ever any Gentleman Å¿o affronted? now Å¿hall I be ArreÅ¿ted for 500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and nothing Å¿o much grieves me, but it will happen in your Company; were it not for bringing you into trouble, I would Å¿cour theÅ¿e Rogues to the Devil and farther; theupon half drawing his Sword, in the mean while the pretended Officers and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor enter the Room, and a Sham-Å¿cuffle begins, but <hi>Mr. Shark</hi> at length Å¿urrenders, in reÅ¿pect, as he Å¿ays, to his dear Friend, that he may come to no harm among Å¿uch Villians: Then they begin to Treat, the Creditor owns the money has been due but a little while, but his craving NeceÅ¿Å¿ities forced him to this Ungentile Action; he will be willing to take part, and Bond for the reÅ¿t, with Security; and Å¿o huÅ¿h up the Matter, that it Å¿hall not redound to his DiÅ¿grace, for he knows he is about a great Fortune. Then <hi>Mr. Shark</hi> wiÅ¿hfully looking on his Companion, in a piteous Tone, aÅ¿ks if he will be Å¿o
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35213:21"/>kind in this Matter, proteÅ¿ting he has a ThouÅ¿and Pound to receive in ten days, left him by an Uncle lately dead. The Young man perhaps Humms and Haws a little at firÅ¿t, as being Å¿urpriÅ¿ed and Å¿tun'd with this Novel Accident: but upon freÅ¿h Intreaties and PromiÅ¿es, that he Å¿hall not be damaged by it, the value of a pins-point, between willing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing he conÅ¿ents, if he has ten or twenty Guine is about him, that's layed down in part; if not, what he has Å¿uffices; and <hi>Mr. Shark</hi> adds to it what his Pockets afford, and a joint Bond is given for the reÅ¿t, but made payable in a very Å¿hort time, leÅ¿t the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany Å¿hould be diÅ¿covered; for this is no other, than a Confederacy between them, and when the Money is paid, the Sham-Officer and Creditor, have a Å¿mall Å¿hip out of it, for MidwiÅ¿ing this Plot of <hi>Mr. Sharks</hi> begetting.</p>
               <p>Our Sham-Creditor knows his day of payment, as well as a Racking Landlord, thoÅ¿e of the four Quarters of the Year, and goes punctually to the Young-man for it; which Å¿tartles him: For <hi>Mr. Shark</hi> to carry on farther his CorreÅ¿pondence, told him the debt was paid, Bond taken up, Cancell'd and Burnt; but Å¿eeing his Hand againÅ¿t him, and not having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the Money, is in a peek of troubles. Mr. <hi>Shark</hi>'s CounÅ¿el is now wanting, for he abÅ¿conds 'till the bluÅ¿ter is over. If he can borrow of Friends, or on Plate, Rings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to raiÅ¿e the Sum, it goes no farther; if not, the threats of a Goal makes him run upon Extreams, either preÅ¿ently to Å¿hut up, or go down into the Country to Å¿ee his Uncle or what is worÅ¿e, Å¿ign a warrant of Attorney, to Enter up Judgement, without thinking of taking a Defei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance; and all is Å¿eized, himÅ¿elf put to Å¿hift, if he eÅ¿capes Å¿o, and his real Creditors cheated. If in this Extremity, to prop up his Credit, he flatters
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35213:22"/>himÅ¿elf to lean on his SiÅ¿ters Portion, by borrowing it of her, he is there likewiÅ¿e diÅ¿appointed; for upon Enquiry, ten to one Å¿he is wheedled on't, or clandeÅ¿tinely Married to one of <hi>Sharks</hi> Shabby Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who decoyed her with the flattering hopes of being a Lady; for Å¿he was aÅ¿Å¿ured by <hi>Shark,</hi> he was a Knight, and his EÅ¿tate in Å¿uch a County, worth 5000 <hi>per Annum;</hi> kept his Coach, and many other fine things: and this Marriage he told her, muÅ¿t be celebrated without the knowledge of any of her neareÅ¿t Relations, leÅ¿t the Knight too long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, Å¿hould fly off; and indeed the poor innocent Girl, by Mr. <hi>Shark</hi>'s appointment, Å¿tealing to a <hi>Spring-Garden</hi> Entertainment, eager to poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s Loves delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fruits, fond, and over perÅ¿waded, the Marriage was huddled up upon little more than meer Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, fancying a Man, her wiÅ¿e Brother had often prais'd in her hearing, as the beÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t cordial of his Friends, would never be Å¿o baÅ¿e, as to betray the SiÅ¿ter unto a miÅ¿erable Misfortune; when aÅ¿hamed of Å¿uch a ViÅ¿ionary Love, by Advice, and her own Inclination, Å¿he concluded to keep her Marriage Å¿ecret, till a more favourable Opportunity to reveal it; but this unlucky Accident, extorted more early, than elÅ¿e Å¿he would have diÅ¿cloÅ¿ed it, and one happineÅ¿s in the midÅ¿t of MiÅ¿ery, our young Shop-keeper may comfort himÅ¿elf in, <hi>viz.</hi> That he had not a Street-trotting Crack impoÅ¿ed on him, inÅ¿tead of a huge Fortune: And this was declined not Å¿o much for his Å¿ake, as that they were reÅ¿olved to Å¿hare his Fortune amongÅ¿t them, without taking in any more Partners, where theÅ¿e Devices are not practicable, and frequently they hit; but our <hi>Shark</hi> has other ways; <hi>viz.</hi> to ruin our YoungÅ¿ter by prompting him on to Gaming, Whoring and ExpenÅ¿iveneÅ¿s, and when he is forced to hide his Head, he pretending all the

And indeed our <hi>Town-Shark,</hi> keeps up the Humour of his Folly by many Devices, leÅ¿t his UnderÅ¿tanding, which he cauÅ¿es to be locked up in a dark Cellar, all the time he deals with him, Å¿hould get looÅ¿e, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trate his DeÅ¿ign; if he underÅ¿tands Å¿ober People have given him Advice, tending to his Good, in reclaiming, and bringing himÅ¿elf within Bounds, he inveighs and exclaims againÅ¿t them, as too cenÅ¿ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Enemies to Youthful PleaÅ¿ure, becauÅ¿e grown old, or wanting the advantage, they cannot purÅ¿ue them; and never leaves, till he Å¿ets him at variance with them; or if this is beyond his power, he will Pipe, Drink, Fiddle, and Å¿ing their grave CounÅ¿el out of his Thoughts, and with a Whirlwind raiÅ¿ed, by breathing Oaths and the direÅ¿t Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his Cordial FriendÅ¿hip, and Å¿incerity to do him Good, blow it to the Land of Oblivion. If the Young man at any time deÅ¿ires his Company to

               <p>If our <hi>Shark</hi> has brought a young Beginner to a declining condition, but there is Å¿omething remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby he expects Å¿ome further advantage, to keep him from Starting, he gravely admoniÅ¿hes him, with much Å¿eeming concern for his Å¿inking Å¿tate, to enter himÅ¿elf a PriÅ¿oner in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> or <hi>Kings-Bench;</hi> telling him, the MarÅ¿hal or Warden, or their Clarks are his intimate Friends, and for a little Money (for Å¿ays he, you may very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit among Gaol-keepers, there is not much Civility to be expected without it) he will get him to be a PriÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at large; and then a Fig for his Creditors, &amp; their Catch-Poles; and perhaps the Young-man grievi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly peÅ¿tered, with a parcel of Civility-Varlets, hearkens to this, and gives him his own Reckoning, which is twice as much, as he has bargained for, on his behalf. But this will not do, for the Creditors Å¿eeing themÅ¿elves thus like to be cheated, if he eÅ¿capes a Statute, are eager to Å¿ue him to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he tells <hi>Mr. Shark</hi> of this, and that the next Term he expects it, aÅ¿king his Advice, who putting on a grave Countenance, and Å¿haking his Noddle, Å¿olemnly proteÅ¿ts he knows not what to think on it; he did not imagin they would be Å¿o haÅ¿ty, but if it comes to Execution, he cannot warrant him, but that he may be Å¿ent for in, and made a cloÅ¿e Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oner: And perhaps if the Wind blows Å¿o hard in that Corner, there may be Statutute of Bankrupt in it, for ought he knows: And therefore in Å¿ober-Å¿adneÅ¿s, he adviÅ¿es him to Knock off in time, make
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35213:23"/>the moÅ¿t of what he has, and away to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he may Set-up again out of their reach, with the Money he Å¿hall raiÅ¿e, or fall into other BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s, promiÅ¿ing to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t; and that it muÅ¿t be done Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly.

And by this knowing what Stages he will make, loth that he Å¿hould carry Å¿o much Money away with him, he has not been many Hours departed, but he haÅ¿tens to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿halÅ¿ea or Warden, or to his Bail, if he had any, tells them their PriÅ¿oner is gone, and it may be gets a Guinea or two, to direct them how to Å¿end Hue and Cry after him; when poor Peel-garlick, by this unexpected DiÅ¿covery being purÅ¿ued, taken, and brought back, is cloÅ¿e confined to hard-meat, but is ignorant who was the Informer.

               <p>One thing more I have to offer, and Å¿o I Å¿hall conclude this Chapter.</p>
               <p>One Villanous Trick, both the <hi>Town-Å¿hift</hi> and

                  <hi>Shirk,</hi> (for here I muÅ¿t join them,) put indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently on Gentlemen and Trades-men, as they find opportunity, they uÅ¿e perÅ¿waÅ¿ion to inveigle them to Ride out of Town ten or twenty Miles, to take the Air; and rather than they will want his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they have a deÅ¿ign upon, a HorÅ¿e Å¿hall-be furniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him at their charge, with Boots, HolÅ¿ters, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tols, Sword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Å¿o riding on very frolicÅ¿ome, and Å¿porting with PaÅ¿Å¿engers they meet on the Road, at laÅ¿t upon Å¿ome turning or elbowing way, at a diÅ¿tance; one of them cryes yonder is an old Cormudgeon coming, let us take a frolick to fright him. Our Gentle-man or Trades-man in company, ignorant of what is intended, Å¿ays perhaps little to the matter, and Å¿o they come cloÅ¿e up, when <hi>Shift</hi> or <hi>Shirk</hi> claps a PiÅ¿tol to the Mans BreaÅ¿t, and with an Oath bids him Deliver; whereupon he piteouÅ¿ly cryes out, he is utterly undone, the reÅ¿t of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany (except our Gentleman or Trades-man, who knows not what to think of it) laugh and Cry, let the old Rogue go, however, the other winking, as much as to Å¿ay, he deÅ¿igns to fright him more, fum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Å¿earches him, and in a Å¿light Å¿truggling this Å¿uppoÅ¿ed Country-man, (a Fellow of their Gang, Å¿ent thither in that diÅ¿guiÅ¿e) on purpoÅ¿e to watch their coming tumbles from his HorÅ¿e, roars out lamentably of the bruiÅ¿e he has received, but more piteouÅ¿ly cryes, he's undone, he's undone; whereat whipping his HorÅ¿e to drive him a diÅ¿tance from his, they leave him in that pickle, and ride away laughing as hard as they can drive; but this proves no laughing Matter, to our young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Trades-man in the end; for this Sham-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man has notice where he lives, Å¿oon finds him out, charges him as one of the Highway-men that robbed him, threatning and Hectoring at Å¿uch a rate,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35213:24"/>that being conÅ¿cious of what they termed a Frolick, and not knowing what to think of, or where to find them, and fearful of aÅ¿king Advice, his Reputation in that being at Stake, beÅ¿ide the known danger of the Law, he finds himÅ¿elf conÅ¿trained to comply with the Fellow's demands, to huÅ¿h up the matter.

               <argument>
                  <p>The lively Character of a <hi>Sharper,</hi> or ordinary <hi>Town-Shift.</hi> His ways to get acquainted with <hi>Shop-keepers Apprentices,</hi> and others; how he deludes them from their BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s, brings them into bad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, Bubbles them of their Money, puts <hi>Jilting Strumpets,</hi> or <hi>Cracks</hi> of the Town, upon them; with other MiÅ¿chiefs, to the Ruin and DiÅ¿grace of many of them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT cannot be denied, but Society is coveted and deÅ¿ired by all; nothing in the Creation can be truly Å¿aid to be averÅ¿e to it. But how dangerous a thing it is to venture unadviÅ¿edly, too many know by Å¿ad Experience; particularly, the giddy Younger Å¿ort, whoÅ¿e green Heads are not furniÅ¿hed with a Å¿ound Judgment to diÅ¿cern what may be advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, and what deÅ¿tructive.</p>
               <p>It is not the multitude of Acquaintance, but the goodneÅ¿s of it, that is to be choÅ¿en and coveted; and it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible but he muÅ¿t be Å¿ullied with-Vice, who crouds himÅ¿elf into Company at a venture.</p>
               <p>But what cares our <hi>Sharper</hi> with whom he aÅ¿Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, they can Å¿carce be worÅ¿e than himÅ¿elf: he cares not a Pin what their Vices are, Å¿o he can
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35213:25"/>extract his beÅ¿t Benefit from them; and if they are timorous, he Å¿tudies to make them vicious, that they may be more at his Devotion.</p>
               <p>His acquaintance with Youth, is the firÅ¿t Draught of thoÅ¿e he intends to ruin; he lays them down before him, as the foul Copy, before he can Write true and perfect: From hence, as from a Probation, he takes his Degree in their ReÅ¿pects, 'till at laÅ¿t he wholly poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es them; and by theÅ¿e means, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priates and incloÅ¿es to himÅ¿elf, what before lay in common.</p>
               <p>But to keep my Method through the whole Work, I now proceed to give the Reader Å¿ome Account; who and what this <hi>Rake-Hell</hi> is, before I proceed to his wicked Practices on Youth.</p>
               <p>He is a Fellow, as the reÅ¿t, pretending to Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of Birth; and to back the Reputation he would force from hence, is ever babbling of his Rich Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whom he places too remote for any one to trouble himÅ¿elf about an Enquiry. Though his Name agreeing with Å¿ome PariÅ¿h or other, makes it preÅ¿umed he was dropt by Å¿ome Å¿trowling Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar or canting GipÅ¿y; and drag'd up by a blear-ey'd NurÅ¿e, 'till he was able to Å¿hew her and his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors a fair pair of Heels; as being frighted away with the Bugbear of being put Apprentice to Å¿ome Å¿curvy Trade: for the thoughts of Labour turns his Stomach, makes him Å¿icken, and is worÅ¿e he fears than a DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e, or a fit of the Stone.</p>
               <p>The firÅ¿t thing he pitches upon, being now deÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Friends and a Habitation, is to liÅ¿t, and Å¿eaÅ¿on himÅ¿elf among the <hi>Black-Guard;</hi> becoming very induÅ¿trious at his Entrance, to learn their Rogueries, in Filching, Managing the Dey, Luck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-a-Bag, Pricking at the Girdles, Hocus-Pocus, and the various Tricks and Stratagems of a <hi>Sweetner.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:35213:25"/>
               <p>The next thing is, to learn Bawdy Songs, and by herding among the St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Scrapers; for Pots of Ale, he is taught Å¿ome lamentable Tunes on the Violin; and his converÅ¿ation with Foot-boys who wait for their MaÅ¿ters at corners of Streets, gives him an opportunity to practiÅ¿e on the Flute, or Å¿uch-like Wind-InÅ¿trument. And to Å¿ute himÅ¿elf more to the Humours of the Times, if poÅ¿Å¿ible, he procures in Å¿ome blind AlehouÅ¿e or other haunted by that Nation, a little Å¿mattering of <hi>French.</hi> And now he thinks himÅ¿elf Å¿et up, were not a Genteel Sute of Cloaths wanting, the better to introduce him into the company of thoÅ¿e he deÅ¿igns to practiÅ¿e on. For this Supply, he does not long cudgel his Brains, ere an Opportunity offers it Å¿elf to Å¿upply that Defect. He Å¿aunters about <hi>WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi>'s, 'till he Å¿ees a Nobleman's or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Door open, and the PaÅ¿Å¿age clear as far as he has a proÅ¿pect; then having a Letter Å¿uperÅ¿cribed to Å¿ome unknown PerÅ¿on; he firÅ¿t peeps about him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But if the CoaÅ¿t be clear, and any Doors open, a Camlet-Cloak, rich Morning-Gown, Plate, or what of value he can light on, is his Prize; and he Å¿oon finds a Broker to take off his Hands at a little more than half the Value, well gueÅ¿Å¿ing how he came by it; and knowing now it's offered, he dares not but take what they bid him, for fear they Å¿hould Å¿top it in their Hands, and make out a Writ of Enquiry, that it may come the knowledge of the true Owner. With this Money he equips himÅ¿elf pretty tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;

Thus well rigg'd he Å¿trowls the City, and there fortune, as he terms it, throws in his way Å¿ome Renegado from his Trade; one that is reÅ¿olved to be wicked, mangre all the Good of his MaÅ¿ter and Relations; he finds him a fit InÅ¿trument to join with, and Å¿o they become Å¿worn Brethren in Iniquity. He uÅ¿es this unthinking Bubble as his Decoy, to allure Å¿ome Apprentices of his Acquaintance into his company; magnifying him to them, as the moÅ¿t accompliÅ¿hed Man he ever met withal, and that his ConverÅ¿ation is Å¿o facetious and charming, that they cannot better divert themÅ¿elves than in it; eÅ¿pecially when BuÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s ceaÅ¿es, and gives place to their Evening-Recreation; promiÅ¿ing they Å¿hall have Singing and MuÅ¿ick to entertain them, if a convenient Place can be appointed, free from DiÅ¿covery.</p>
               <p>This Bait, no doubt, Å¿ome of them preÅ¿ently nibble at, not diÅ¿cerning the fatal Hook it covers, 'till Å¿truck; and a Place is appointed to meet in the Evening: our <hi>Shift</hi> has notice of it from his Renegado-Scout, and fails not to come, provided with his Implements, dreÅ¿Å¿ed in the BeauiÅ¿h FaÅ¿hion: his <hi>Carolina</hi> laced, pinched up in three Corners; his long Wig poudered, and Coat Mealed to the Å¿mall of his Back.

PromiÅ¿ing him as Encouragement, if he draw good Wine, Å¿omething over and above the Reckoning, that will fall to his Share. The Room Å¿hewn, he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35213:27"/>enters, and takes his place at the upper end of the Table, calls for a Flask, and Å¿its humming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, 'till the YoungÅ¿ters drop in one by one, and are a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l received by him with profound Ceremony and ReÅ¿pect; Å¿peaking little, 'till his Scout comes in, who waits on the Stairs the while, to direct the YoungÅ¿ters as they come up; that they may not miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Room, bolt into other Company unawares, or be Å¿een by Å¿uch as may inform their MaÅ¿ters or Parents. For under this Head I compriÅ¿e not only Apprentices, but Youths that are under the Tuition of their Friends: for this Haggard flyes at both. When no more are expected at this time, the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer or Petty MaÅ¿ter of the Ceremonies makes an Harangue to them, how exceeding glad he is to Å¿ee Å¿o many of his Croneys, giving them a hearty Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and bidding them to be merry.</p>
               <p>Then our <hi>Shift</hi> taking up the GlaÅ¿s, turns off a Brimmer to their ProÅ¿perity, and Å¿o paÅ¿Å¿es it about. And when it has pretty well gone round, their Spirits beginning to be exhilerated with the Juice of the Grape, he makes an Apology, that for his Friend's Å¿ake, he being altogether a Stranger to them, he is made Å¿o happy as to be bleÅ¿Å¿ed with their good Company; and that if any thing lies in him to Å¿erve them, now or any other time, they may not only requeÅ¿t, but command it. Then changes his DiÅ¿courÅ¿e, and falls upon an Encomium, praiÅ¿ing the Youth of the City, as the Prop and Ornament of it; and uÅ¿es all his Stock of Flattery, to Å¿well them with a Conceit of their Parts and Abilities; whil'Å¿t they Å¿it liÅ¿tening with their Mouths at half-cock, in a Å¿teady attention to his fallacious Dialect; being Å¿truck to admiration with his fine way of Speaking: and from that time, they think him a PerÅ¿on well educated, and of Parts and Learning.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:35213:28"/>
               <p>When he perceives he has gained a Point, he makes a full Å¿top, Å¿its Å¿ilent a while, and then drinks about; which done, his Companion perÅ¿wades him to give them a Tune or two, on his Flute, or Haut-boy, which he readily agrees to; then pulling out Å¿ome Songs Å¿et to MuÅ¿ick, though he knows not the Notes; to bear them in hand he Å¿ings them, looking on his paper: After that, Å¿o feed their CurioÅ¿ity farther, out comes <hi>Jack-in-a-box,</hi> and other Imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, uÅ¿ed in the Art of <hi>Hocus-pocus,</hi> or <hi>Leger-de-main;</hi> and by Å¿light of Hand, Å¿eems to do Miracles, appearing to them no leÅ¿s, than a topping Conjurer, or dealer in the Black Art: So that much taken with the Man, their Hearts grow open, and after whiÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together, one is deputed to Å¿tep down and order a Treat, that they may in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, for his civil Obligements, and at parting will not Å¿uffer him to pay a Farthing, though he draws his Money, and earneÅ¿tly preÅ¿Å¿es to do it, whilÅ¿t his Eye is on their hands, to Å¿ee who draws moÅ¿t Money; for it is a Vanity in Youth on Å¿uch occaÅ¿ions, in oÅ¿tentation to pull out all they have about them at once, and make a rattling with it, though there be but a trifle to pay: Nor does he forget to aÅ¿k what 'tis a clock, pretending Å¿ome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment he has made, to meet a Friend, or an AÅ¿Å¿ignation with a Lady, whom for the World he would not diÅ¿appoint; when the main drift of it is, to Å¿ee how they are accommodated, with Watches, at this time no Gaming is propoÅ¿ed, unleÅ¿s they propoÅ¿e it themÅ¿elves, and then he Å¿eems to diÅ¿ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, or put it off to a more Å¿eaÅ¿onable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, becauÅ¿e it will waÅ¿te more time, that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent it will be convenient perhaps for them; but eÅ¿pecially for him to Å¿pare: And the reaÅ¿on that moves him Å¿o to do is, becauÅ¿e he keeps this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35213:28"/>till he can Å¿ingle them one by one, and bubble them to his greater advantage: And Å¿o at this time they break up, appointing the next meeting, and every one departs highly Å¿atisfied, no Complements being Å¿pared on either hand.</p>
               <p>After two or three General Meetings he becomes intimately acquainted with them, knows all their Names, and the Places of their Abode; and now it is his BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s to Å¿ingle them out, that his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igns may be carried on more cloÅ¿e and cunningly, and that with celerity, that they may not have time to take Air; and concluding he has no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uÅ¿e for his Tool or Implement of a <hi>Renegado Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice</hi> he firÅ¿t wrought withal, but proving a Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on, he may become troubleÅ¿om and dangerous, his next buÅ¿ineÅ¿s is to Å¿hut his hands of him; and can propoÅ¿e to himÅ¿elf no Å¿urer way, than by pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to one of the Plantations, for that will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce two Advantages, <hi>viz.</hi> To hinder his telling Tales, and making a Prize of him. This reÅ¿olved on, he profeÅ¿Å¿es a world of FriendÅ¿hip to him, boaÅ¿ts that he has been a great Traveller, and how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ant it is to be abroad; commends the Civility and Good Nature of Forreigners to the Skies, and what great EÅ¿tates and Preferments Young-men have got abroad, who at home were deÅ¿titute of Friends and Habitations: then perceiving the Cully attentive to what he Å¿ayes, he demands if he be willing to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and he will help him to a Merchants Service, who will entertain him at Fifty Pounds a Year, his HorÅ¿e, and good Table, to be OverÅ¿eer of a Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Our YoungÅ¿ter being caÅ¿t off by his Friends for his lewd way of Living, and the Tricks he has played to to their prejudice and diÅ¿grace, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t weary of a Raking Life, attended with Want, ten to one hearkens to this; if he does, his next
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35213:29"/>BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s is to look out for a MaÅ¿ter-Kidnapper, who is to repreÅ¿ent the Merchant, he is bound by Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but with Å¿olemn promiÅ¿es of Freedom: only this is a complying with the Law, for otherwiÅ¿e, if Å¿earch be made, it would obÅ¿truct his paÅ¿Å¿age: and thus being underhand for a Å¿mall matter, he is wood-cocked into Slavery, to repent at leiÅ¿ure his Folly, in not knowing when he was well in the EÅ¿teem of his Friends, and placed with a good MaÅ¿ter, with whom had he Å¿erved out his Time, it might have been the making of him for ever.

If the Young-man is not over-credulous in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he has many Stories at his Tongues-end, taken out of Novels and Romances, that Loves irreÅ¿iÅ¿tible Power has compelled Queens to lay their Diadems at the Feet of Shepherds; and great PrinceÅ¿Å¿es who might have had Kings with Kingdoms to their Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to doat on a Slave. But the PreÅ¿ents and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are not required, till he firÅ¿t Å¿ee the Lady; yet it muÅ¿t be at a diÅ¿tance, and as if by chance, and no Å¿peaking to her, the firÅ¿t time at leaÅ¿t. In the mean while, he rooks Money out of him, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliÅ¿h him in playing on the Flute, Violin, Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to make a Courtlike AddreÅ¿s, and Compliment alamode; that his Parts and Knowledge Abeing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, he may be the fitter Match for a Lady: And all this while the Young-man treats high, however he pinches to come by it, and rarely they part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gaming, which drains his Pockets; but what cares he, this great Match will abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: And for Diet and other NeceÅ¿Å¿aries, there needs no Money to purchaÅ¿e that, for he knows who is bound to provide it for him.</p>
               <p>If his Stock at any time fails, he can borrow of neighbouring Apprentices, and many times they have a common Stock amongÅ¿t them, to Å¿upply ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent neceÅ¿Å¿ities.

But not to dwell too long on this Matter, when he has dreined him of all his Money, Goods, Wearing Apparel, which he obliges him to take up of his Taylor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Å¿ees there is little more coming; or that the Young-man thus deluded, begins to Å¿mell a Rat, he drops off; and leaves him to Å¿eek this Lady in the Clouds, where he can find her; which if he happens to do, he will be never the wiÅ¿er, for Å¿he is altogether ignorant of the Matter; and if he Å¿hould be Å¿o fooliÅ¿h to make any preÅ¿umptuous PretenÅ¿ions, confiding what he told him is real, he may happen to get a good Drubbing, be ToÅ¿Å¿ed in a Blanket, or worÅ¿e uÅ¿ed; as I knew one Å¿erved not long Å¿ince, who built on the Å¿ame Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35213:31"/>to get his Pocket-book, or Å¿omething that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably known to be his, which perhaps at that time he miÅ¿Å¿es not, nor does Å¿he give him time to do it; for in a great huff, with Threats and bent Brows, Å¿ometimes forcing Tears, which Å¿he has at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Å¿he flings away; and if a <hi>Bully-Rock,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be her HuÅ¿band, enter not preÅ¿ently with a Sham-ConÅ¿table and Warrant, to demand Satisfaction for the AbuÅ¿e done to his Wife; to be Å¿ure within a Day or two the Youngman is Å¿ent for to the Tavern, hemn'd in by two or three grim look'd Fellows, charged with the rude AbuÅ¿e which has made the Woman MiÅ¿carry, and endangered her Life; then threatned, with abundance of hard Words, mingled with dire Imprecations; if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, they produce what Å¿he took from him, as a demonÅ¿trable WitneÅ¿s: So that at legth not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to Å¿ay or think of the matter, he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es, to Å¿ave his Reputation, and the farther danger he may incur, an Accommodation, and Å¿o they fleece him of his ready Money, Rings, Watch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but theÅ¿e wanting, if of Age, they take Å¿omething in part, and bring him into Bond, which they have ready, to fill up themÅ¿elves; for they are as fraid to have it known, as he is; for that they are Å¿ure will Å¿poil their Market. If this Å¿eems to be the laÅ¿t Stake, then <hi>Mr. Shift</hi> leaves our YoungÅ¿ter; if not, when he hears of it, he rages, raves and Å¿torms at a prodigious rate, vowing they Å¿hall repent putting Å¿uch a Trick upon his Friend: Then by degrees growing milder, begins to chide the Youngman for being Å¿o unadviÅ¿edly raÅ¿h; when the truth is, he went away and left them together, to no other end then to bring this about: And if before it was made up he had been Å¿ought to mediate the matter, it would have been as hard to have found him, as a

               <p>Sometimes there is another Stratagem of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the wind, though the Youngman frolicks on a Barren Heath where nothing will grow; yet the Å¿ubtil Female will in a little time appear pregnant with a CuÅ¿hion, and Å¿ending for him to a Tavern or Å¿ome other more convenient place, with a He or She confident to back the DeÅ¿ign, and calls her SiÅ¿ter, upon his firÅ¿t approach with, a feigned PaÅ¿Å¿ion will burÅ¿t into Tears, Å¿obbing and Å¿ighing under her Hood for a pretty Å¿pace, whilÅ¿t the Youngman Å¿tands in admiration, what Å¿hould cauÅ¿e this Å¿udden PaÅ¿Å¿ion, and who this Å¿hould be; doubtful whither to advance or retreat, the DiÅ¿Å¿embling Sorrowful Crack Companion intreats him to Å¿it down, and Å¿hutting the Door, carefully liÅ¿tens, as to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med if any be near, and then in a grave Å¿et Speech begins, Sir, do not you know my SiÅ¿ter here? And when he proteÅ¿ts he does not; well, continues he or Å¿he, you did once, to her Shame and the DiÅ¿grace of our Family, never Å¿tained before; though now perhaps you would willingly blot her out of your remembrance: But that Å¿hall not excuÅ¿e you, nor Å¿erve your turn, hold up your head <hi>Betty,</hi> and let the Gentleman Å¿ee your Face more plainly, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freÅ¿h his treacherous Memory; nay never bluÅ¿h for the matter, what's done cannot be recalled: But one would have thought you might have been wiÅ¿er before this had happened: Upon this our Å¿eemingly diÅ¿treÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed DamÅ¿el riÅ¿es, wipes her Eyes, uncovers her Face, and Å¿hews Å¿omething like a great Belly, and with a Sigh Å¿ays, Sir do you not know me?

               <p>TheÅ¿e are not all the Intrigues to bubble Young-men, and gull them out of their Money; for Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times walking together, Sweeteners are laid by appointment in their way, who purpoÅ¿ely drop Money or BraÅ¿s-Rings gilded, and Å¿uddenly taking them up, as if realy found, our Hawks-eyed <hi>Shift</hi> Å¿teps forward, and cryes halves Gentlemen, you have found Å¿omething, and it is but reaÅ¿onable we Å¿hould Å¿ee what it is; nay, Å¿ays one of the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if you Å¿ee me take it up, it is but fair you Å¿hould: Then it is produced, perhaps Half-a-Crown, Half-Guinea, or a Ring, if the firÅ¿t or Å¿econd, one of the Stweeteners propoÅ¿es to go to Å¿uch a HouÅ¿e, and there divide it equally over a Pot of Beer, Ale or a GlaÅ¿s of Å¿uch as the HouÅ¿e affords: For Å¿ince they had Å¿uch good luck in accidentally jumping together, it is all the reaÅ¿on in the World, they Å¿hould not part with dry Lips.

What would any one now have this poor Gentleman do? his Father Dead, his Elder Brother's Old Suits and he are much alike in requeÅ¿t; he's caÅ¿t off with a little Money in his PurÅ¿e, that the Sight and Memory of him and his Father may periÅ¿h together. This makes him hate the Country, and to <hi>London</hi> he comes, in hopes to improve his Breeding, by learning the ModiÅ¿h-ways of the Town; but falling in with <hi>Sharpers,</hi> he is Å¿oon bubbled of the little Money he brought from home, yet learns Experience by it, and Å¿eeing it a thriveing Trade, reÅ¿olves by degrees to proceed to the practice of it; and to be the better ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, reÅ¿orts Ordinaries, Coffee-houÅ¿es and Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, where he overlooks and gathers Å¿omething from their DiÅ¿courÅ¿e and Managment of Policies and Intrigues, Cheats, Wheedles, Culling, Shams, and the like; and leÅ¿t his Memory prove Treacherous when he has occaÅ¿ion to uÅ¿e them, he notes them down in his Pocket-Book as <hi>Memorandums;</hi> furniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himÅ¿elf over and above with PleaÅ¿ant JeÅ¿ts and Merry Tales; but for all this practiÅ¿ing on Men, he frequently finds his Silly Banter turned on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, and is often Buffooned and outw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

This one <hi>Mamouchee</hi> brings him acquainted with the Women, and he Å¿oon finds their Blind-Å¿ide, how much Flattery is pleaÅ¿ing to them, and Å¿erves as Satan's Bellows, to blow up the leaÅ¿t Spark of Pride into a Flame; for having learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Dance the Antick, he is for Å¿ome time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to be his UÅ¿her, which over and above gets him large acquaintance with the Tender Sex; and his Study is next, how he may beÅ¿t Humour them, and Å¿o decoy them into misfortune.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:35213:36"/>then out comes a Lampoon, which he inÅ¿inuates was lately made on Å¿ome PerÅ¿on of Quality; reads it, and cunningly Å¿kips over the Smutty or Bawdy part of it.

For if at any time they have a mind to be Treated, he Scruples not to do it with much Gallantry and GeneroÅ¿ity, as knowing how to reimburÅ¿e himÅ¿elf in the ConcluÅ¿ion: Out of this incloÅ¿ed <hi>Seraglio</hi> he plays the Grand Seignor, Calls out one beÅ¿t pleaÅ¿ing to him, or Richer than the reÅ¿t, waits on her to the Park, a Ball, or Play; in each of which he Infinitely pleaÅ¿es, giving her an opportunity to ExpoÅ¿e her Beauty and Gallantry; but whilÅ¿t Å¿he is endeavouring by all her Arts and Subtiltys to Å¿et her Å¿elf off for Sale, little thinks Å¿he that he is practiÅ¿cing on her EaÅ¿ineÅ¿s and over-Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, to ruin her in her Faine and Fortune; for Ten to One, that he may not tickle his Trout too long, and Å¿o run the hazard of loÅ¿eing her, he enflames her with Wine, into which he Å¿ecretly conveys provoking Drugs in fine Ponder, not diÅ¿cernable in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids, to heat her Blood, and heighten her DeÅ¿ires; then by a Å¿mooth inÅ¿inuating Flattery, with delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Words, he corrupts her Judgment, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers her ConÅ¿cience, which made her before to Å¿tart at the Thoughts of any Å¿uch thing: So that with little Scruple an AÅ¿Å¿ignation is made, and Å¿he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently Surrenders her Honour without Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and from that moment he dates her PerÅ¿on and Fortune at his diÅ¿poÅ¿al.

And now I Å¿hall conclude this Chapter, with Å¿ome Å¿ober Advice and Caution to young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Gentlewomen, as to their Carriage and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, to avoid the Snare Å¿o frequently laid by Crafty Men, to intrap them at Unawares.</p>
               <p>To Men therefore you are to have a Behaviour that may Å¿ecure you without offending them; no ill-bred affected ShineÅ¿s nor roughneÅ¿s, unÅ¿utable to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35213:38"/>your Sex, and unneceÅ¿Å¿ary to your Virtue; but Å¿uch a way of Behaviour as may prevent all coarÅ¿e Ralleries or unmannerly Freedoms; a Look that may forbid without RudeneÅ¿s, and Oblige without Invitation, or leaving room for Mens Å¿awcy Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to Å¿uggeÅ¿t advantages over you, or their Vanities ot lay hold on: for gaining the leaÅ¿t En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, or Hope to Triumph over your Virtue. This point is Å¿o very nice, that it ought to engage you to have a perpetual Watch on your Eyes; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idering that a careleÅ¿s Glance often gives more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement than many Words; the Language of the Eyes is very Significant, and Cunning, DeÅ¿igning Men can interpret it to your Prejudice, and their own Advantage. Your Civility, which is always to be preÅ¿erved, muÅ¿t not be carried Å¿o high as a Compliance, which may Betray you into irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble MiÅ¿takes.</p>
               <p>Beware of the Vanity of deÅ¿iring to gain a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queÅ¿t over Men, as Å¿ome fooliÅ¿hly attempt to do; and like the Moth, burn themÅ¿elves in the Flames; nay think themÅ¿elves Å¿ecure of not having their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour tainted by it. Some are fondly apt to believe their Virtues obÅ¿cure, and not Å¿ufficiently known, unleÅ¿s expoÅ¿ed by a larger, or Å¿et out to the beÅ¿t advantage, by Å¿ome publick Trials; but theÅ¿e are dangerous Experiments, and uÅ¿ually fail, being built on the weak Foundation of too great a Confidence in themÅ¿elves. It is as dangerous to Play with Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as to Dally with Gallantry. it is a ConÅ¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againÅ¿t your Å¿elves, and giving Treacherous Men a power to gain an eaÅ¿y ConqueÅ¿t; and from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Admirer, Å¿oon becomes Victor, and grows to be a MaÅ¿ter over your Affections. The firÅ¿t reÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Å¿topping at a good Opinion and EÅ¿teem, by degrees grows weaker againÅ¿t the Charms of InÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35213:38"/>and Flattery Å¿kilfully applied, you will be apt to think a Man Å¿peaks to much ReaÅ¿on, whilÅ¿t he is Commending you, that you will have much ado to believe him in the wrong, when he is Craftily undermining you, and inÅ¿enÅ¿ibly, as it were Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away your Affections. And, over and above the natural Inclination your Sex has to be merciful, you are apt to be Bribed by a well-choÅ¿en Flattery, and Å¿o are in danger to be taken like a Bird liÅ¿tening to the Call of a Fowler, that has laid a Snare for it.</p>
               <p>ConqueÅ¿t is Å¿o tempting a thing, that it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes you miÅ¿take Mens SubmiÅ¿Å¿ions, which with all their fair appearances, have generally leÅ¿s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect than Art in them: Therefore let it be your BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s, to remember where there is a Å¿ly InÅ¿inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without much OÅ¿tentation of fine Words or Compliments, you are to Å¿uÅ¿pect a DeÅ¿ign, to gain admittance under a DiÅ¿guiÅ¿e; therefore you ought to be upon your guard, and conÅ¿ider, that of the two, ReÅ¿pect is more dangerous than Anger; it puts for a time the beÅ¿t UnderÅ¿tandings out of their place, 'till Å¿econd Thoughts reÅ¿tore them; it Å¿teals inÅ¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ibly upon you, and throws down your Defences, making it too late to ReÅ¿iÅ¿t after that advantage is is given: whereas Anger moÅ¿tly breaketh out into a found, and paÅ¿Å¿ing away in a noiÅ¿e, gives warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Cautious; whilÅ¿t ReÅ¿pect is a Å¿low, yet a certain PoiÅ¿on that Å¿wells you; and where it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth too much, it turns to a kind of Apoplexy in the Mind, turning it quite round; and after once it has Å¿eized the UnderÅ¿tanding, becometh Mortal. For theÅ¿e ReaÅ¿ons, the Å¿ecureÅ¿t way is to Treat it like a Å¿ly and crafty Enemy, and to be perpetually on the Watch, Guarded againÅ¿t it.</p>
               <p>To treat here of ReÅ¿ervedneÅ¿s, would be too long, eÅ¿pecially to enumerate all the Advantages that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:35213:39"/>it; therefore I Å¿hall only Å¿ay it is a Guard to thoÅ¿e that are Virtuous of your Sex; and a DiÅ¿guiÅ¿e to Å¿uch as are Vicious: and of Å¿o much uÅ¿e to both, that thoÅ¿e who refuÅ¿e to practiÅ¿eit as a Virtue, ought to uÅ¿e it as an Artifice.</p>

               <p>Upon this occaÅ¿ion, putting himÅ¿elf into the beÅ¿t Garb Fortune at preÅ¿ent will afford him, he Saunters, caÅ¿ting his Eye at every Shop or open Door, to mark out the Game he intends to make his Flight at: If he eÅ¿pies a neat LaÅ¿s, whereby he gueÅ¿Å¿es Å¿he well deÅ¿erves in her Service, and may be in Stock to anÅ¿wer in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure his expectation, whether Å¿he be intendant of the upper Stories, or SuperviÅ¿or of the Dripping-pan, Chamber or Cook Maid, it matters not, for all is FiÅ¿h with him that comes to Net: he Å¿tares her wiÅ¿hfully in the Face, and takes a turn or two backward and forward, as if he had Å¿ome knowledge of her; or Å¿o as if he we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And by Å¿uch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, Å¿tealing inÅ¿enÅ¿ibly into the Maids unguarded Affections, Å¿he Å¿cruples not for the future to meet him by appointment, or come to him, if her time will poÅ¿Å¿ibly give her leave, when he Å¿ends for her.

The eaÅ¿ie loving Fool, blinded with PaÅ¿Å¿ion, preÅ¿ently concludes, he wants this Money chiefly to provide things neceÅ¿Å¿ary for their Wedding, but is AÅ¿hamed to own it, on that accompt freely offers what aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance Å¿he can give him, and if all her ready Money Å¿eems not to Å¿atisfie him, Å¿he will not Å¿tick upon the leaÅ¿t motion he makes, if Å¿he be in credit, to Borrow of her Fellow-Servants; But as Å¿he has been inÅ¿tructed, conceals from them to what end Å¿he does it; however, after this he leaves not off making his ViÅ¿its, for he has yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Game to play, and under the notion of being her CoÅ¿in, has at length liberty to come to the HouÅ¿e, eÅ¿pecially privately, among the Servants; and then
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:35213:42"/>Bottles of Wine, Ale, or what the HouÅ¿e affords, are pinched at Å¿eaÅ¿onable times and Å¿et by, to Treat; and Å¿he will not Å¿tick to Å¿pare the beÅ¿t Bit Å¿he can Light on out of her own Belly, to put in his; who has, as Å¿he Å¿uppoÅ¿es, been Å¿o king to her, and if there be a fear of Å¿urprize by the MaÅ¿ter or MiÅ¿treÅ¿s, that he may create Anger, Å¿he has a By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloÅ¿et to hide him, or Å¿ometimes for haÅ¿te per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, Whelms him under a large WaÅ¿h-Tub or Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing VeÅ¿Å¿el, where he may peep through the half Bung-hole, like a Dog under a door, to Å¿ee when the CoaÅ¿t is clear, though that Å¿he is as careful of that as he, to give the hint, upon the firÅ¿t opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to be packing.</p>
               <p>By this means he has an opportunity to Å¿ee the ways of the HouÅ¿e, and if himÅ¿elf wants Courage to be actually concerned in the Undertaking, yet he is intelligent enough to give Directions to thoÅ¿e that will Rob it; and indeed many over-fond Girls have been drawn in to be conÅ¿enting to, and furthering Å¿uch WickedneÅ¿s, at the coÅ¿t of their Lives, and the DiÅ¿grace of their Relations; who had they not met with Å¿uch Seducers, would never have Dreamed of any thing like it. And of theÅ¿e, I could name many, whoÅ¿e hard Fates have been pittied and much lamented, as not properly their inclination or fault, but their misfortune.

               <p>The poor deceived Girl takes this as a Mighty kindneÅ¿s, and punctually obeys him; then he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys her with her Luggage, to a Lodging he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, where he is not known; telling the people before her face Å¿he is his Wife; this makes her bluÅ¿h, but being ordered before not to deny it, Å¿ince they are Å¿o by PromiÅ¿e, and Å¿hortly Å¿hall be legally joined, Å¿he accords with him in it; and Å¿o for a while one Bed Å¿erves them both: but after a Week or two, he Å¿ends her on a SleeveleÅ¿s Errand, and paying off the Lodgings, companions of his own, in the Habit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </argument>
               <p>AS for the Tricks and Cheats that the foregoing MiÅ¿creants uÅ¿e in Gaming, eÅ¿pecially when they draw in Young People to Cheat and Bubble them out of their Money, they are Å¿o many and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, it would Å¿well a large Volume to Å¿et them down in order; nor had I done it briefly, but to make good my PromiÅ¿e to the Reader.</p>
               <p>If they Å¿et upon you with Cards, in the firÅ¿t place, in their Dealing, by the Reflection of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿hed Steel Tobaco-Box, or a drop of Wine or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before them on the Board, unminded by you, they will Å¿o order it, that they will Å¿ee the Cards they deal you, and Å¿o Play by your Hand; and if it is objected, they cannot Å¿ee the Colour of the Spots this way, it is eaÅ¿ie however, to know them by their form.</p>
               <p>If the Pack paÅ¿Å¿es but a few times about, they will mark all the Winning Cards, Å¿o to know them as the Game requires; Å¿ecuring in the Sleeve, a Muff that lyes before them, or Cocking a pinched-up Hat is a uÅ¿ual way; if all the Cards be not required to be out, Å¿ome of theÅ¿e <hi>Sharpers</hi> have a Dog with them, that will bring Cards under the Table, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him Å¿ecretly by a Confedrate on the other Å¿ide, and carry back what is given him by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter: They have Signs and Watch-words, Å¿o often changed, that few underÅ¿tand them but themÅ¿elves; Winking, Laughing, Drawing the Mouth to one Å¿ide or other, Blowing the NoÅ¿e, rubbing the Forehead,

If at <hi>Put</hi> one give you two Treys and Ace, to dare you to be bold, or to Double Stakes, doubt not but your AntagoniÅ¿t has two Treys and a Duce, to bite your Head off, as in their <hi>Cant</hi> they phraÅ¿e it. They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten put the Change upon you, if they find your Memory treacherous, in taking up the Cards; under pretence of Å¿eeing what was Played. They fail not to have the Winning Cards of another Pack about them, and where they Å¿ee an Opportunity, make uÅ¿e of them; and as cunningly withdraw them again, upon the Shuffling.</p>
               <p>FalÅ¿e Dice they always carry about them, which they Å¿ecure in their Hand often, with the Chance uppermoÅ¿t; though they Å¿eem to the unÅ¿kilful Player to come out of the Box, and have an Art in Shaking, to rattle them as if they were really in; and when they have done Throwing, by Å¿light of Hand, convey them away, and put the other to Throw with thoÅ¿e they produce. Sometimes they have them with Quick-Å¿ilver Å¿hut up in a hollow of the corner, or in the Center, as the Chance is to run; which will hit to thoÅ¿e that know how to place them in throwing, but run croÅ¿s to the Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter that knows nothing of it; with much more of the like Nature: But my DeÅ¿ign being to diÅ¿Å¿wade from Gaming, I Å¿hall no farther enlarge on the Cheats practiÅ¿ed in it, but conclude with Å¿ome Sound Advice.</p>
               <p>To Play Å¿ometimes, to divert ones Å¿elf; or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain civil Company, is not Å¿o much to be diÅ¿allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
